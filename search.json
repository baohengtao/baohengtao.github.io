[{"categories":["tech"],"content":"The steps to generate a CA (Certificate Authority) with OpenSSL, using the RSA algorithm, with passphrase protection, along with detailed explanations of each step and its options:\nGenerate CA Enter the following command to create a new private key and set a passphrase:\n1 openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca.key 4096 This command generates an AES-256 encrypted RSA private key with a key length of 4096 bits and outputs it to a file named ca.key. You'll be prompted to enter a passphrase twice. Choose a strong and unique passphrase that you can remember.\nNext, you need to create a self-signed root CA certificate using the private key you just created. Enter the following command:\n1 openssl req -x509 -new -key ca.key -sha256 -days 3650 -out ca.crt This command creates a new self-signed CA certificate, signed with the private key created in step 2. The -x509 option specifies that the output is a self-signed certificate, -new specifies that a new certificate is being created, -key ca.key specifies the private key to be used to sign the certificate, -sha256 specifies the hash algorithm to be used to sign the certificate, -days 3650 specifies the validity period for the certificate (in this case, 10 years), and -out ca.crt specifies the output file name for the certificate.\nReview the CA certificate you just created. You can use the following command to view the certificate contents:\n1 openssl x509 -in ca.crt -noout -text This command displays the contents of the CA certificate in human-readable form. Verify that the information in the certificate looks correct.\nsave CA as P12 Following command convert a CA (Certificate Authority) certificate to a P12 format:\n1 openssl pkcs12 -export -out certificate.p12 -inkey ca.key -in ca.crt In this command, certificate.p12 is the name of the output file that will contain the converted P12 certificate. ca.key is the private key file that corresponds to the CA certificate. And ca.crt is the original CA certificate file in PEM format. You will then be prompted to set a password for the P12 file.\nIn Surge, P12 is convert to text using base64:\n1 base64 -i certificate.p12 you can recover it to p12 as following:\necho \"BASE64-ENCODED-TEXT\" | base64 -d \u003e ca.p12 Convert P12 to CA you can recover ca.p12 to ca.key and ca.crt using following command:\n1 2 3 openssl pkcs12 -in ca.p12 -out ca.key -nocerts openssl pkcs12 -in ca.p12 -out ca.crt -nokeys The first command extracts the encrypted private key from the PKCS12 file and saves it to ca.key. The -nocerts option tells OpenSSL to exclude the certificate from the output. During the command execution, OpenSSL will prompt you to enter the password that was used to encrypt the private key.\nThe second command extracts the certificate from the PKCS12 file and saves it to ca.crt. The -nokeys option tells OpenSSL to exclude the private key from the output.\nGenerate and sign certificate with CA Now that you have a CA certificate, you can use it to sign other certificates. To demonstrate, we'll create a new server certificate and sign it using our CA certificate.\nFirst, we need to create a private key for the new server certificate. Enter the following command:\n1 openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048 This command generates a new RSA private key with a key length of 2048 bits, and outputs it to a file named server.key.\nNext, we need to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using the private key we just created. Enter the following command:\n1 openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr This command creates a new CSR using the private key server.key, and outputs it to a file named server.csr. During the CSR creation process, you'll be asked to enter information about your server, such as its Common Name (CN), Organization, and Location.\nNow that we have a CSR, we can sign it with our CA certificate. Enter the following command:\n1 openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -out server.crt -days 365 This command signs the CSR using our CA certificate (ca.crt) and private key (ca.key). The -in server.csr option specifies the input file to be signed, -CA ca.crt specifies the CA certificate to use for signing, -CAkey ca.key specifies the private key of the CA, -out server.crt specifies the output file name for the signed certificate, and -days 365 specifies the validity period for the signed certificate (in this case, 1 year).\nReview the signed server certificate you just created. You can use the following command to view the certificate contents:\n1 openssl x509 -in server.crt -noout -text This command displays the contents of the signed server certificate, including the information from your CSR, and the signature from the CA certificate.\nThat's it! You now have a CA, a CA certificate, and a signed server certificate. Keep the CA and CA certificate safe and secure, as they will be required to sign other certificates.\n","description":"","tags":["network"],"title":"Creating  CA and Signing Certificates","uri":"/tech/https-ca/"},{"categories":["tech"],"content":"若 DNS 设置为 system, 在开启 surge 的 DHCP server 时，会有如下错误。提示需增加 DNS.\nPlease configure at least one DNS server in Surge's DNS settings. You cannot depend on the system's DNS settings if Surge acts as the DHCP server.\n处于好奇，开始研究开启 surge 时 dns 的表现。为叙述方便，假设「路由器地址」和「DNS 地址」均为 192.168.1.1\n增强模式 在只开启代理模式时，DNS 无变化，为 192.168.1.1. 开启增强模式时，DNS 变为 198.18.0.2, 并有有如下提示：\nSome applications may not obey the system proxy settings. Using enhanced mode can make all applications handled by Surge.\nSurge will setup a virtual network interface (VIF) and register as the default route. All DNS questions will get answers with a virtual IP in 198.18.0.0/15 block.\n所有的 DNS 查询都将被 VIF 接管，VIF 返回一个处于 198.18.0.0/15 网段的 Fake IP, 真正的 DNS 查询由 VIF 发往 DNS 设置。\n网关模式 在开启网关模式时，所有被接管设备的 system's DNS 变为 192.18.0.2, 并返回虚假 IP, 图为 iOS 设备的 DNS 解析结果\n这也意味着，若通过域名如\"device.local\"连接本地设备时，因为得到的 IP 位于 198.18.0.0/15 网段，请求并不会直接发往本地设备，而是发往网关，再由网关进行中转。\n当被接管设备开启 Surge 增强模式时，情况发生了变化，此时由于本地 VIF 已经被分配了 192.18.0.2, 所以发往 System's DNS(192.18.0.2) 的请求无效。需要另外设置 DNS 地址，且该 DNS 地址必须经过网关。如8.8.8.8. 此时网关会劫持 8.8.8.8 的 DNS 请求，并返回 Fake IP\n若设置了一个局域网内的 DNS 地址会发生什么呢？由于此时网关无法接管 DNS 请求，得到的流量都是指向一个个 IP 地址而没有域名信息 所以此时根据域名定义的分流规则会失效，且无法看到流量的域名。\n当 DNS 设置为 192.168.1.1 时，可以看到设备返回了 Real IP, 而不是 198.18.0.0/15 网段的 Fake IP, 说明 DNS 解析未经手网关。\n可以从网关的设备请求列表看到，其 URL 都是一个个 IP 地址，而不包含 Domain\niOS 设备上的表现 不同于 macos, 开启 Surge 时 DNS 地址并未发生变化。且被接管时的表现也未发生变化。可能 iOS 上的运行机制有所不同，iOS 上的 Surge 并未占用 198.18.0.2.\n","description":"","tags":["network"],"title":"Surge 的 DNS 与 DHCP","uri":"/tech/surge_dhcp/"},{"categories":["tech"],"content":"今天在将代码推送至 GitHub 仓库时，遇到了如下连接问题：\n\u003e git push kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host Connection closed by 198.18.1.45 port 22 fatal: Could not read from remote repository. 经过排查，发现使用代理连接时出现了问题，但在关闭代理后，连接正常。进一步检查后发现代理节点禁用了 22 端口，因此需要将端口改为 443 端口才能正确连接。\n为了解决这个问题，可以在本地的 SSH 配置文件中对 GitHub 的主机进行特定配置，将端口修改为 443 端口。\n具体方法是在~/.ssh/config文件中增加如下内容：\n1 2 3 4 5 $ cat ~/.ssh/config Host github.com Hostname ssh.github.com Port 443 这样就能成功连接 GitHub 仓库了。\n参考: [2022-03] GitHub 加速终极教程 - V2EX\n","description":"","tags":["git"],"title":"解决 GitHub 的 SSH 连接问题","uri":"/tech/github_proxy/"},{"categories":["tech"],"content":"Modulation with DSSS/CCK DSSS/CCK data symbol is formed by spreading and modulating the data bits.

末期『人类』人口: 532万 食物采集者的生活: 没有成立任何正式的配置专职领导人的政治机构 。通常只是各自成群地结合成自治的团体，团体人数一般是20-50人。 男女关系是平等的。作为食物采集者的女性不仅生育和抚养小孩，而且还提供了大部分食品。 部落成员之间有着很亲密的血族关系。每一个人都要对他人承担责任，从而享有权利和特权。 在旧石器时代，不但不遵守部落传统的人会被杀掉，而且在食物短缺时，婴儿和身体虚落的人也会被杀掉。 食物采集者乐意吃的食物数量很大，保证了他们的生活所需。同时他们依靠大量不同种类的动植物作为其食物来源，这就使得他们比农民过的更为充裕。 出现了宗教仪式。到旧时代末期，出现了尚未完全脱离生产活动的巫医或巫师。 新石器时代(食物生产者) 该时代特点:\n食物大半或全部来源于栽培植物和畜养动物 使用磨制法制作石器 有关植物生长的基本原理早在农业革命数千年前就已为人类所知道，其推迟如此之久才付诸实践的原因如下:\n在正常情况下，靠捕猎为生的原始人不仅有充足的食物，而且还有极为丰富的食物品种。 比起种养食物的农民，靠捕猎为生的原始人为获取食物所需的劳作时间更短。成年人平均每周仅花15个小时去狩猎和采集食物 可以栽培的植物和可以驯养的动物为数较少 农业发生的原因 人口的压力，破坏了狩猎社会得以安逸舒适地生存下去的平衡。随着以后人口缓慢且不断的增长，靠捕猎为生的原始人不得不以自己种植的食物来补充采集食物的不足。 在植物驯化的过程中，野生动植物越长越大，从而提供了更多的食物。因此 靠捕猎为生的原始人也就花费越来越多的时间去做食物生产者，而不是食物采集者——— 最后他们就变成了居住在村庄中的居民。 农业的传播过程由于早期农业的低效率———食物栽培时断时续，经常需要换地方————而得到了促进。 当农业人口快速增长并迁徙到世界各地时，食物采集者的人数远远落后了，而且被排挤出大部分土壤肥沃的地区。 食物生产者的生活 为了照料新驯化的动植物，人类不能不定居下来。新石器时代的村庄取代了旧石器时代的流浪团体而成为人类最基本的经济文化单位。定居的生活方式使人们能拥有更为丰富的生活资料。 定居生活也使部落政治组织取代各游猎民族单独的群体成为可能。构成新石器时代的村社的社会基本单位是由若干对夫妻和他们的孩子组成的大家庭。 经济平等和社会地位相同，是新时期时代村社的明显特征。不过正是由于该特征，其生产力都有着内在的阻碍性因素。产品的产量只要能满足每个家庭有限的传统需要就可以了，没有要求生产剩余产品的动力。部落中社会关系的平等也扩展到部落中的两性关系上。 宗教上，农夫们开始需要并设想了种种能照管他们的田地，牲畜和家庭的新的神灵。 人种: 蒙古利亚人种；高加索人种(白种人)；黑种人；|| 布希曼人；俾格米人；澳大利亚人种 || 人性的本质 人类生来即不爱好和平，也不喜欢战争；即不倾向合作，也不倾向侵略。决定人类行为的不是他们的基因，而是他们所处社会教给他们的行事方法。++p.37++\n欧亚大陆的古典文明(公元500年之前) ##最初的欧亚大陆文明(公元前3500年——公元前1000年)\n古代文明的起源 将「文明」与新石器时代的「部落文化」区别开来的 『文明的一些特征』包括:城市中心，由制度确立的国家的政治权力，纳贡或税收，文字，社会分为阶级或等级，巨大的建筑物，各种专门的艺术和科学。 文明的共同特征表明，这种新型的社会完全不同于早先崇尚平等的部落社会。\n新的农业生产技术和新的社会制度相互作用，引起一个连锁反应，最终导致文明的出现。\n后起的阶级分化是文明的特征。 当村庄发展为城市时，社会宗教生活的中心从圣祠发展为寺院。 寺院有祭司和仆从，他们是最早不必直接从事生活资料生产的人。 后来新出现的祭司，不仅要对传统的各种超自然的现象负责，还要负起不断增加的管理社会的各种职责。 ** 文字** 是祭司们出于记事的需要而做出的一大发明。\n社会成分 的日益多样开始破坏宗教显贵们的地位。 同时人口增长超过了农业资源，引发了大规模的，频繁的战争，最终祭司们的权力逐渐转到了世俗新贵们的手上。\n文明的传播 当部落人口增加，对食物的需求也相应增大时，部落社会便无法与生产率高得多的文明社会相对抗。诸文明社会之所以会生产率高，是因为它们是建有国家机构的阶级社会，国家机构能从农民身上榨取税收和租金。为了支付税收和租金，文明社会的农民不得不比部落社会的耕种者更努力的工作。\n古代文明的共性 社会不平等：所有文明都是建立在纳贡关系而不是血亲关系的基础上++p.56++ 两性间的不平等： 新型农业为文明提供了经济基础，但同时又破坏了妇女在经济上的独立地位。妇女们发现参与新的农业是非常困难的，渐渐地不再是与男人平等的食物提供者。 男人们竭尽全力地去确保自己实际上是其继承人的亲生父亲，于是富裕的上层人士制定了严格的规章制度和周密的预防措施，以控制女性的性活动。 游牧民族 公元前第二个千年，整个欧亚大陆的力量均势开始转变，诸伟大文明的生存第一次受到游牧民的威胁。 马的驯养和较迟出现的冶铁技术是两个至关重要的发明，他们使游牧民获得了新的生命力。\n马的驯养：\n公元前5000年前后，中东地区最早开始驯养动物和骑乘动物。++ 开始只有牛和野驴++ 公元前2500年，驯养动物的做法向北传到了产有野驴和野马的俄国南部，这两种动物在该地得到驯养。 公元前2千纪，游牧民使用战车掀起入侵浪潮 公元前2千纪末，用骑兵取代战车 三大游牧民族:\n南部沙漠地带的闪米特部落民 欧亚大草原西部的印欧人 欧亚大草原东部的蒙古——突厥各族 ","description":"","tags":["历史"],"title":"Global History","uri":"/study/global-history/"},{"categories":["study"],"content":"What Are Social Psychology’s Big Ideas social psychology(社会心理学): The scientific study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another. social neuroscience:(社会认知神经科学): An interdisciplinary field that explores the neural bases of social and emotional processes and behaviors, and how these processes and behaviors affect our brain and biology. Social psychology is the scientific study of how people think about, influence, and relate to one another. Its central themes include the following:\nHow we construe our social worlds. How our social intuitions guide and sometimes deceive us. How our social behavior is shaped by other people, by our attitudes and personalities, and by our biology. How social psychology’s apply to our every day lives and to various other fields of study. How do Human Values Influence Social Psychology culture(文化): The enduring behaviors, ideas, attitudes, and traditions shared by a large group of people and transmitted from one generation to the next. social representations(社会表征): A society’s widely held ideas and values, including assumptions and cultural ideologies. Our social representations help us make sense of our world. Social psychologist’ value penetrate their work in obvious ways, such as their choice of research topics and the type of people who are attracted to various fields of study. They also do this in subtler ways, such as their hidden assumptions when forming concepts, choosing labels, and giving advice. This penetration of values into science is not a reason to fault social psychology or any other science. That human thinking is seldom dispassionate is precisely why we need systematic observation and experimentation if we are to check our cherished ideas against reality. Is Social Psychology Simply Common Sense hindsight bias(后见之明偏差): The tendency to exaggerate, after learning an outcome, one’s ability to have foreseen how something turned out. Also known as the I-knew-it-all-along phenomenon. Social psychology is criticized for being trivial because it documents things that seem obvious. Experiments, however, reveal that outcomes are more “obvious” after the fact are known. The hindsight bias (the I-knew-it-all-along phenomenon) often makes people overconfident about the validity of their judgments and predictions. Research Methods theory(理论): An integrated set of principles that explain and predict observed events. field research(现场研究): Research done in natural, real-life settings outside the laboratory. correlational research(相关研究): The study of the naturally occurring relationships among variables. experimental research(实验研究): Studies that seek clues to cause-effect relationships by manipulating one or more factors (independent variables) while controlling others (holding them constant) framing(框定): The way a question or an issue is posed; framing can influence people’s decisions and expressed opinions. replication: Repeating a research study, often with different participants in different settings, to determine whether a finding could be reproduced. mundane realism(现世现实主义): Degree to which an experiment is superficially similar to every day situations. experimental realism(实验现实主义): Degree to which an experiment absorbs and involves its participants. deception(欺骗): In research, an effect by which participants are misinformed or misled about the study’s methods and purposes. demand characteristics(需求特征): Cues in an experiment that tell the participant what behavior is expected. informed consent(知情同意): An ethical principle requiring that research participants be told enough to enable them to choose whether they wish to participate. debriefing(事后解释): In social psychology, the post-experimental explanation of a study to its participants. Debriefing usually discloses any deception and often queries participants regarding their understandings and feelings. Social psychologists organize their ideas and findings into theories. A good theory will distill an array of facts into a much shorter list of predictive principles. We can use those predictions to confirm or modify the theory, to generate new research, and to suggest practical application. Most social psychological research is either _correlational_or experimental. Correlational studies, sometimes conducted with systematic survey methods, discern the relationship between variables, such as between amount of education and amount of income. Knowing two things are naturally related is valuable information, but it is not a reliable indicator of what is causing what—or whether a third variable is involved. When possible, social psychologists prefer to conduct experiments that explore cause and effect. By constructing a miniature reality that is under their control, experimenters can vary one thing and then another and discover how those things, separately or in combination, affect behavior. We randomly assign participants to an experimental condition, which receives the experimental treatment, or to a control condition, which does not. We can then attribute any resulting difference between the two conditions to the independent variable. By seeking to replicate findings, today’s psychologists also assess their reproducibility. In creating experiments, social psychologists sometimes stage situations that engage people’s emotions. In doing so, they are obliged to follow professional ethical guidelines, such as obtaining people’s informed consent, protecting them from harm, and fully disclosing afterward any temporary deceptions. Laboratory experiments enable social psychologists to test ideas gleaned from life experience and then to apply the principles and findings to the real world.

Fiber is famous for its beneficial health effects but not listed in essential nutrients. The reason is that most fiber pass through the body unabsorbed, and omitting it from the diet does not reliably cause a specific deficiency disease. ##Nutrient Recommendations\nDietary Reference Intakes (DRI) : a set of five lists of values for measuring the nutrient intakes of healthy people in the US and Canada. The lists are Recommended Dietary Allowances(RDA): nutrient intake goals for individuals; the average daily nutrient intake level that meets the needs of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) healthy people in a particular life stage and gender group. Adequate Intakes(AI): nutrient intake goals for individuals set when scientific data are insufficient to allow establishment of an RDA value and assumed to be adequate for healthy people. Tolerable Upper Intake Levels(UL): the highest average daily nutrient intake levels that are likely to pose no risk of toxicity to almost all healthy individuals of a particular life stage and gender group. Estimated Average Requirements(EAR): nutrient values used in nutrition research and policy making and the basis upon which RDA values are set; the average daily nutrient intake estimated to meet the requirement of half of the healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender group. Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges(AMDR): values for carbohydrate, fat, and protein expressed as percentages of total daily caloric intake; ranges of intakes set for the energy-yielding nutrients that are sufficient to provide adequate total energy and nutrients while minimizing the risk of chronic diseases. Estimated Energy Requirement(EER): The average dietary energy intake predicted to maintain energy balance in a healthy adult of a certain age, gender, weight, height, and level of physical activity consistent with good health. Daily Values: nutrient standards used on food labels and on grocery store and restaurant signs. It reflect the highest level of nutrient need among all population groups, from children of age 4 years through aging adults.

The Self in a Social World Rehearsal\nSpotlights and Illusion： 周围的人并没有我们所想象的那么在意我们。我们知道自己的内心活动，我们觉得这些活动很明显，那是因为我们总是习惯把注意力放在自己身上。其他人更关心的是自己，而不是我。 Self-concept: 我们对自我的认知并非总是正确。我们可以分析出 Verbalized explicit attitudes, 但是 implicit attitude 确很难描述 2.1 Spotlights and Illusion spotlight effect(焦点效应): The belief that others are paying more attention to our appearance and behavior than they really are. illusion of transparency(透明度错觉): The illusion that our concealed emotions leak out and can be easily read by others. Concerned with the impression we make on others, we tend to believe that others are paying more attention to us than they are (spotlight effect) We also tend to believe that our emotions are more obvious than they are (the illusion of transparency). 2.2 Self-concept: Who am I self-concept(自我概念): What we know and believe about ourselves self-schema(自我图式): Beliefs about self that organize and guide the processing of self-relevant information. social comparison(社会比较): Evaluating one’s abilities and opinions by comparing oneself with others. individualism(个人主义): The concept of giving priority to one’s own goals over group goals and defining one’s identity in terms of personal attributes rather than group identifications. independent self: Construing one’s identity as an autonomous self. collectivism(集体主义): Giving priority to the goals of one’s group (often one’s extended family or work group) and defining one’s identity accordingly. planning fallacy(规划谬误): The tendency to underestimate how long it will take to complete a task. impact bias: Overestimating the enduring impact of emotion-causing events. dual attitude system: Differing implicit (automatic) and explicit (consciously controlled) attitudes toward the same object. Verbalized explicit attitudes may change with education and persuasion; implicit attitudes change slowly, with practice that forms new habits. Our sense of self helps organize our thoughts and actions. When we process information with reference to ourselves, we remember it well (using our self-schemas). Self-concept consists of two elements: the self-schemas that guide our processing of self-relevant information and the possible selves that we dream of or dread. Cultures shape the self, too. Many people in individualistic Western cultures assume an independent self. Others, often in collectivistic cultures, assume a more interdependent self. These contrasting ideas contribute to cultural differences in social behavior. Our self-knowledge is curiously flawed. We often do not know why we behave the way we do. When influences upon our behavior are not conspicuous enough for any observer to see, we, too, can miss them. The unconscious, implicit processes that control our behavior may differ from our conscious, explicit explanations of it. 2.3 The Nature and Motivating Power of Self-esteem self-esteem(自尊): A person’s overall self-evaluation or sense of self-worth. terror management theory(恐惧管理理论): Proposes that people exhibit self-protective emotional and cognitive responses (including adhering more strongly to their cultural world-views and prejudices) when confronted with reminders of their mortality. longitudinal study: Research in which the same people are studied over an extended period of time. self-efficacy(自我效能): A sense that one is competent and effective, distinguished from self-esteem, which is one’s sense of self-worth. A sharpshooter in the military might feel high self-efficacy and low self-esteem. Self-esteem is the overall sense of self-worth we use to appraise our traits and abilities. Our self-concepts are determined by multiple influences, including the roles we play, the comparisons we make, our social identities, how we perceive others appraising us, and our experiences of success and failure. Self-esteem motivation influences our cognitive processes: Facing failure, high-self-esteem people sustain their self-worth by perceiving other people as failing, too, and by exaggerating their superiority over others. Although high self-esteem is generally more beneficial than low, researchers have found that people high in both self-esteem and narcissism are the most aggressive. Someone with a big ego who is threatened or deflated by social rejection is potentially aggressive. Self-efficacy is the belief that one is effective and competent and can do something. Unlike high self-esteem, high self-efficacy is consistently linked to success. 2.4 Self-serving Bias self-serving bias: The tendency to perceive oneself favorably. self-serving attributions(自我服务归因): A form of self-serving bias; the tendency to attribute positive outcomes to oneself and negative outcomes to other factors. defensive pessimism(防御性悲观主义): The adaptive value of anticipating problems and harnessing one’s anxiety to motivate effective action. false consensus effect(虚假普遍性效应): The tendency to overestimate the commonality of one’s opinions and one’s undesirable or unsuccessful behaviors. false uniqueness effect(虚假独特性效应): The tendency to underestimate the commonality of one’s abilities and one’s desirable or successful behaviors. Contrary to the presumption that most people suffer from lower self-esteem or feelings of inferiority, researchers consistently find that most people exhibit a self-serving bias. In experiments and everyday life, we often take credit for our success while blaming failures on the situation. Most people rate themselves as better than average on subjective, desirable traits and abilities. We exhibit unrealistic optimism about our futures. We overestimate the commonality of our opinions and foibles (false consensus) while underestimating the commonality of our ability and virtues (false uniqueness) Such perceptions arise partly from a motive to maintain and enhance self-esteem — a motive that protects people from depression but contributes to misjudgment and group conflict. Self-serving bias can be adaptive in that it allows us to savor the good things that happen in our lives. When bad things happen, however, self-serving bias can have maladaptive effect of causing us to blame others or feel cheated out of something we “deserved”. 2.5 Self-presentation self-handicapping(自我妨碍): Protecting one’s self-image with behaviors that create a handy excuse for later failure. self-presentation(自我表露): The act of expressing oneself and behaving in ways designed to create a favorable impression or an impression that corresponds to one’s ideals. self-monitoring(自我监控): Being attuned to the way one presents oneself in social situations and adjusting one’s performance to create the desired impression. As social animals, we adjust our words and actions to suit out audiences. To varying degrees, we note our performance and adjust it to create the impressions we desire. Sometimes people self-handicap with self-defeating behaviors that protect self-esteem by providing excuses for failure. Self-presentation refers to our wanting to present a favorable image both to an external audience (other people) and to an internal audience (ourselves). With regard to an external audience, those who score high on a scale of self-monitoring adjust their behavior to each situation, whereas those low in self-monitoring may do so little social adjusting that they seem insensitive. 2.6 Self-control Self-control is like a muscle: It can get tired when you use it too much. Willpower requires energy. But self-control can get stronger if it’s used more. Improving self-control in one area leads to improvements in others. 2.7 Post-script: Twin Truths—The Perils of Pride, the Powers of Positive Thinking This chapter offered two memorable truths: the truths of self-efficacy and the truth of self-serving bias. The truth concerning self-efficacy encourage us not to resign ourselves to bad situations. We need to persist despite initial failures and to exert effort without being overly distracted by self-doubts. Likewise, secure self-esteem can be adaptive. When we believe in our positive possibilities, we are less vulnerable to depression and we feel less insecure.\nThus, it’s important to think positively and try hard, but not to be so self-confident that our goals are illusory or we alienate others with our narcissism. Taking self-efficacy too far leads to blaming the victim: If positive thinking can accomplish anything, then we have only ourselves to blaming if we are unhappily married, poor, or depressed. For shame! If only we had tried harder, been more disciplined, less stupid. This viewpoint fails to acknowledge that bad things can happen to good people. Life’s greatest achievements, but also its greatest disappointments, are born of the highest expectations.\nThese twin truths — self-efficacy and self-serving bias — remind us of what Pascal taught 300 years ago: No single truth is ever sufficient, because the world is complex. Any truth, separated from its complementary truth, is a half-truth.\n3. Social Beliefs and Judgments 3.1 How do we judge our social worlds, consciously and unconsciously We have an enormous capacity for automatic, efficient, intuitive thinking (System 1). Our cognitive efficiency, although generally adaptive, comes at the price of occasional error. Because we are generally unaware of those errors entering our thinking, it is useful to identify ways in which we form and sustain false beliefs. Our preconceptions strongly influence how we interpret and remember events. In a phenomenon called priming, people’s prejudgments have striking effects on how they perceive and interpret information. We often overestimate our judgments. This overconfidence phenomenon stems partly from the much greater ease with which we can image why we might be right than why we might be wrong. Moreover, people are much more likely to search for information that can confirm their beliefs than for information that can disconfirm them. When given compelling anecdotes or even useless information, we often ignore useful base-rate information. This is partly due to the later ease of recall of vivid information(the availability heuristic). We are often swayed by illusions of correlation and personal control. It is tempting to perceive correlations where none exist (illusory correlation) and to think we can predict or control chance events (the illusion of control). Moods infuse judgments. Good and bad moods trigger memories of experiences associated with those moods. Moods color our interpretations of current experiences. And by distracting us, moods can also influence how deeply or superficially we think when making judgments. System 1: The intuitive, automatic, unconscious, and fast way of thinking. System 2: The deliberate, controlled, conscious, and slower way of thinking. priming(启动): Activating particular associations in memory. embodied cognition(具身认知): The mutual influence of bodily sensations on cognitive preferences and social judgments. automatic processing: “Implicit” thinking that is effortless, habitual, and without awareness; roughly corresponds to “intuition.” Also known as System 1. controlled processing: “Explicit” thinking that is deliberate, reflective, and conscious. Also known as System 2. overconfidence phenomenon: The tendency to be more confident than correct——to overestimate the accuracy of one’s beliefs. confirmation bias(验证性偏差): A tendency to search for information that confirms one’s preconceptions. heuristic(启发式判断): A thinking strategy that enables quick, efficient judgments. representativeness heuristic(代表性启发式判断): The tendency to presume, sometimes despite contrary odds, that someone or something belongs to a particular group if resembling (representing) a typical member. availability heuristic(易得性启发式判断): A cognitive rule that judges the likelihood of things in term of their availability in memory. If instances of something come readily to mind, we presume it to be commonplace counterfactual thinking(反事实思维): Imagining alternative scenarios and outcomes that might have happened, but didn’t. illusory correlation(错觉相关): Perception of a relationship where none exists, or perception of a stronger relationship than actually exists. regression toward the average(趋均数回归): The statistical tendency for extreme scores or extreme behavior to return toward one’s average. 3.2 How do we perceive our social worlds Other experiments have planted judgments or false ideas in people’s minds after they have been given information. These experiments reveal that as before-the-fact judgments bias our perceptions and interpretations, so after-the-fact judgments bias our recall. Belief perseverance is the phenomenon in which people cling to their initial beliefs and the reasons why a belief might be true, even when the basis for belief is discredited. Far from being a repository for facts about the past, our memories are actually formed when we retrieve them, and they are subject to strong influence by the attitudes and feelings we hold at the time of retrieval. belief perseverance(信念固着): Persistence of one’s initial conceptions, such as when the basis for one’s belief is discredited but an explanation of why the belief might be true survives. misinformation effect(误导信息效应): Incorporating “misinformation” into one’s memory of the event, after witnessing an event and receiving misleading information about it. 3.3 How do we explain our social worlds misattribution(错误归因): Mistakenly attributing a behavior to the wrong source. attribution theory(归因理论): The theory of how people explain others’ behavior——for example, by attributing it either to internal dispositions (enduring traits, motives, and attitudes) or to external situations. dispositional attribution(性格归因): Attributing behavior to the person’s disposition and traits. situational attribution(情境性归因): Attributing behavior to the environment. spontaneous trait inference(自发性特质归因): An effortless, automatic inference of a trait after exposure to someone’s behavior. fundamental attribution error(基本归因错误): The tendency for observers to underestimate situational influences and overestimate dispositional influences upon other’s behavior. Attribution theory involves how we explain people’s behavior. Misattribution——attributing a behavior to the wrong source——is a major factor in sexual harassment, as a person in power (typically male) interprets friendliness as a sexual come-on. Although we usually make reasonable attributions, we often commit the fundamental attribution error when explaining other people’s behavior. We attribute their behavior so much to their inner traits and attitudes that we discount situational constraints, even when those are obvious. We make this attribution error partly because when we watch someone act, that person is the focus of our attention and the situation is relatively invisible. When we act, our attention is usually on what we are reacting to——the situation is more visible. 3.4 How do our social beliefs matter self-fulfilling prophecy(自我实现预言): A belief that leads to its own fulfillment. behavioral confirmation(行为确证): A type of self-fulfilling prophecy whereby people’s social expectations lead them to behave in ways that cause others to confirm their expectations. Our beliefs sometimes take on lives of their own. Usually, our beliefs about others have a basis in reality. But studies of experimenter bias and teacher expectations show that an erroneous belief that certain people are unusually capable (or incapable) can lead teachers and researchers to give those people special treatment. This may elicit superior (or inferior) performance and, therefore, seem to confirm an assumption that is actually false. Similarly, in everyday life we often get behavioral confirmation of what we expect. Told that someone we are about to meet is intelligent and attractive, we may come away impressed with just how intelligent and attractive he or she is. 3.5 What can we conclude about social beliefs and judgements View human nature through cognitive social psychology\nResearch on social beliefs and judgments reveals how we form and sustain beliefs that usually serve us well but sometimes lead us astray. A balanced social psychology will therefore appreciate both the powers and the perils of social thinking. 4. Behavior and Attitudes 4.1 How well do our attitudes predict our behavior attitude: Beliefs and feelings related to a person or an event (often rooted in one’s beliefs, and exhibited in one’s feelings and intended behavior). How do our inner attitudes (evaluative reaction toward some object or person, often rooted in beliefs) relate to our external behavior? Although popular wisdom stresses the impact of attitudes on behavior, in fact, attitudes are often poor predictors of behaviors. Moreover, changing people’s attitudes typically fails to produce much change in their behavior. These findings inspired social psychologists to find out why we so often fail to play the game we talk.\nThe answer: Our expressions of attitudes and our behaviors are each subject to many influences. Our attitudes will predict our behavior (1) if these “other influences” are minimized, (2) if the attitude corresponds very closely to the predicted behavior (as in voting studies), and (3) if the attitude is potent (because something reminds us of it, or because we acquired it by direct experience). Under these conditions, what we think and feel predicts what we do.\n4.2 When does our behavior affect our attitudes. role: A set of norms that defines how people in a given social position ought to behave. 4.3 Why does our behavior affect our attitudes ","description":"","tags":["心理学"],"title":"Social Thinking","uri":"/study/social-thinking/"},{"categories":["tech"],"content":"整理文件 将fold-rsync 进行同步, 得到 remote/fold-rsync\n将fold-rsync 硬链接到 fold-work, 在 fold-work内重命名\n确保remote中没有 remote/fold-work 这个文件夹. 将fold-rsync fold-work 一起同步过去, 得到 remote/fold-rsync, remote/fold-work. 在这个过程中, remote/fold-work的内容完全来自remote/fold-rsync的硬连接\n此时可删除fold-rsync, 只保留fold-work.\n参考: https://lincolnloop.com/blog/detecting-file-moves-renames-rsync/\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ gcp -al Weibo Weibo-tmp # local: Weibo-tmp =\u003e Weibo $ rsync-synchronize Weibo Weibo-tmp rpi:/seagate/ # server: Weibo-tmp =\u003e Weibo $ rm rpi:/seagate/Weibo # server: Weibo-tmp $ tidy Weibo # fd . **/原创微博图片 -td -x echo mv -v \"{}\" \"{//}/../..\" $ rsync-synchronize Weibo Weibo-tmp rpi:/seagate/ # server: Weibo same as local but hardlink from Weibo-tmp $ rm Weibo-tmp rpi:/seagate/weibo-tmp Rsync 重命名 1 2 3 4 $ rsync -avHP --delete-after ~/family/Photos remotebox:backups $ cd ~/family $ gcp -rlp Photos Photos-work $ rsync -avHP --delete-after --no-inc-recursive ~/family/Photos ~/family/Photos-work remotebox:backups Rsync 选项 -n, --dry-run: perform a trial run with no changes made\n-z, --compress: compress file data during the transfer\n-h, --human-readable: output numbers in a human-readable format\n-P same as --partial --progress\n-a, --archive :archive mode;

They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). It’s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don’t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.\n标签查看\n1 2 3 git tag #列出标签 git tag -l \"v1.8.5*\" #使用正则表达式筛选标签 git show \"v1.8.5\" # 查看标签具体信息 标签创建\n1 2 3 git tag -a v1.4 -m \"my version 1.4\" # 添加Annotated Tags git tag \u003clight-weight\u003e # 添加 Lightweight Tags git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02 # 为某个commit追加标签 标签删除\n1 git tag -d \u003ctagname\u003e 提取对应标签内容\n1 2 git checkout \u003ctagname\u003e # it will put your repository in \"detached HEAD\" state. git checkout -b \u003cbranch-name\u003e \u003ctag-name\u003e Remote Push git push 默认不会同步标签的添加和删除信息，需要手动添加。\n同步标签创建信息\n1 2 3 git push \u003cremote\u003e \u003ctagname\u003e # push 单个标签 git push \u003cremote\u003e--tags # push 所有标签 git push \u003cremote\u003e --follow-tags # push Annotated tags. 同步标签删除信息\n1 2 3 4 $ git push origin :refs/tags/v1.4- # The way to interpret the above is to read it as the null value before the colon is being pushed to the remote tag name, effectively deleting it. # Another way is following: $ git push origin --delete \u003ctagname\u003e rm 使用cached选项删除已经staged的文件\n1 git rm --cached filename log 输出格式 -p 选项将打印出diff信息； --stat提交统计信息(statistics)； --pretty将打印出格式化的信息。 --graph将以ASCII 图形的方式打印出分支和合并历史 1 2 3 4 5 6 git log # print log of commit git log -p -2 # print log of last two commits with patch info (the diff of file). git log --stat # print abbreviated stats for each commit, git log --pretty=oneline # use pretty option to format print git log --pretty=format:\"%h - %an, %ar : %s\" git log --pretty=format:\"%h %s\" --graph Option Description -p Show the patch introduced with each commit. --stat Show statistics for files modified in each commit. --shortstat Display only the changed/insertions/deletions line from the --stat command. --name-only Show the list of files modified after the commit information. --name-status Show the list of files affected with added/modified/deleted information as well. --abbrev-commit Show only the first few characters of the SHA-1 checksum instead of all 40. --relative-date Display the date in a relative format (for example, “2 weeks ago”) instead of using the full date format. --graph Display an ASCII graph of the branch and merge history beside the log output. --pretty Show commits in an alternate format.

Generate private key openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 825 -out myCA.pem # Generate root certificate 步骤二：生成网页加密用的密钥$NAME.key和证书签发请求$NAME.csr。\n1 2 3 NAME=coopers.zone # Use your own domain name openssl genrsa -out $NAME.key 2048 # Generate a private key openssl req -new -key $NAME.key -out $NAME.csr # Create a certificate-signing request 步骤三：填写证书基本信息$NAME.ext。注意 DNS\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 # Create a config file for the extensions \u003e$NAME.ext cat \u003c\u003c-EOF authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer basicConstraints=CA:FALSE keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment subjectAltName = @alt_names [alt_names] DNS.1 = $NAME # Be sure to include the domain name here because Common Name is not so commonly honoured by itself DNS.2 = *.$NAME # Optionally, add additional domains (I've added a subdomain here) IP.1 = 192.168.0.13 # Optionally, add an IP address (if the connection which you have planned requires it) EOF 步骤四：用 CA 私钥签发证书$NAME.crt.\n1 2 3 4 # Create the signed certificate openssl x509 -req -in $NAME.csr \\ -CA myCA.pem -CAkey myCA.key -CAcreateserial \\ -out $NAME.crt -days 825 -sha256 -extfile $NAME.ext 最终得到如下文件：myCA.pem 和 coopers.zone.crt分别是 CA 公钥和网页证书；myCA.key和coopers.key分别是CA私钥和网页私钥。\n步骤五：将coopers.zone.key和coopers.zone.crt放到服务器中；将myCA.pem添加到系统根证书中。\n参考：ssl - Getting Chrome to accept self-signed localhost certificate - Stack Overflow\n参考 SSL/TLS 协议运行机制的概述 - 阮一峰的网络日志 图解 SSL/TLS 协议 - 阮一峰的网络日志 相关阅读 HTTP 协议入门 - 阮一峰的网络日志 ","description":"","tags":["计算机"],"title":"SSL/TLS 协议","uri":"/tech/ssl-tls/"},{"categories":["tech"],"content":"使用Touch ID 代替密码 Add line in /etc/pam.d/sudo：\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 #

而这些注册信息, 则存储在inode中. inode 每个文件的创建都对应着一个 inode(索引节点)的生成, 它记录着该文件的元信息:\n文件的字节数\n文件的拥有者信息、读写权限\n文件的时间戳, 分别是: ctime指inode上一次变动的时间，mtime指文件内容上一次变动的时间，atime指文件上一次打开的时间。\n链接数, 即有多少文件名指向这个inode\n文件数据block的位置\n每个inode都有一个号码, 操作系统用inode号码来识别不同文件. 当我们打开一个文件时, 系统会找到该文件的 inode 号码; 通过 inode 号码获取inode信息; 最后通过inode信息获取文件数据所在的block.\n目录文件 Unix/Linux 系统中, 目录 (directory) 也是一种文件. 打开目录, 实际上就是打开目录文件.\n目录文件是一系列目录项的列表. 每个目录项, 由两部分组成: 所包含文件的文件名, 以及该文件名的inode号码.\n因此, 目录文件的读和写权限, 都是针对目录文件本身. 如果只有读权限, 只能获取文件名, 无法获取其它信息, 因为其它信息都存储在inode节点中, 而读取inode节点内的信息需要目录文件的执行权限.\n硬链接 每个 inode 可以对应多个文件名. 当创建硬链接时, 相当于增加了一个指向该inode节点的链接数. 反过来, 当删除一个文件时, 则指向该文件的链接数减 1, 当链接数减少到0时, 表示没有文件指向这个inode, 系统就会回收这个inode号码, 以及其所对应block区域.\n创建目录时，默认会生成两个目录项：\".\"和\"..\"。前者的inode号码就是当前目录的inode号码，等同于当前目录的\"硬链接\"；后者的inode号码就是当前目录的父目录的inode号码，等同于父目录的\"硬链接\"。所以，任何一个目录的\"硬链接\"总数，总是等于2加上它的子目录总数（含隐藏目录）。\n软链接 除了硬链接以外，还有一种特殊情况。\n文件A和文件B的inode号码虽然不一样，但是文件A的内容是文件B的路径。读取文件A时，系统会自动将访问者导向文件B。因此，无论打开哪一个文件，最终读取的都是文件B。这时，文件A就称为文件B的\"软链接\"（soft link）或者\"符号链接（symbolic link）。\n这意味着，文件A依赖于文件B而存在，如果删除了文件B，打开文件A就会报错：\"No such file or directory\"。这是软链接与硬链接最大的不同：文件A指向文件B的文件名，而不是文件B的inode号码，文件B的inode\"链接数\"不会因此发生变化。\nln -s命令可以创建软链接。\n参考: Unix系统中的inode\n","description":"","tags":["计算机"],"title":"Unix系统中的inode","uri":"/tech/understand-inode/"},{"categories":["tech"],"content":"更新 Twitter整理 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 # 对于 LIJIA-1203879100760260608-20191209_112839-img1.jpg 的格式 # user-post-time-img # 写入时间 exiftool '-XMP:DateCreated\u003c${Filename;m/(.*)-(.*)-(.*)-(.*)/;$_=\"$3\"}' -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%S # 写入url: twitter.com/$user/status/$post exiftool '-BaseUrl\u003c${Filename;m/(.*)-(.*)-(.*)-(.*)/;$_=\"https://twitter.com/$1/status/$2\"}' exiftool '-ImageCreatorName\u003c${Filename;m/(.*)-(.*)-(.*)-(.*)/;$_=\"$1\"}' exiftool '-ImageCreatorID\u003c${Filename;m/(.*)-(.*)-(.*)-(.*)/;$_=\"https://twitter.com/$1\"}' exiftool '-SeriesNumber\u003c${Filename;m/(.*)-(.*)-(.*)-(.*).([a-z1-9]+)/;$_=\"$4\"}' exiftool -ImageSupplierName=Twitter # 写入标题 exiftool '-Title\u003c$ImageCreatorName' # 将url写入description exiftool '-ImageDescription\u003cBaseUrl' # 将 Twitter 写入关键词 exiftool '-Subject-=Twitter' '-Subject+=Twitter' # 重命名 exiftool '-filename\u003c$DateTimeOriginal-$Title%+2c%E' -d '%Y-%m-%d' -progress -fileorder filename Weibo整理 用户信息生成与更新 首先用如下命令生成数据库文件ImageSupplierName/ImageSupplierID\n1 2 3 4 5 function wb-database-gen(){ SupplierName=\"Weibo\" mkdir -p $CRAWLER_INFO_HOME/$SupplierName fd -td --exact-depth 1 -x exiftool -ImageCreatorID=https://weibo.com/u/{} -ImageSupplierID={} -ImageSupplierName=$SupplierName \"$CRAWLER_INFO_HOME/$SupplierName/{}.xmp\" -progress } 更新数据库文件\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 function wb-database-update{ for file in \"$@\";

It won't print Latitude: $GPSLatitudeRef Longitude: $GPSLongitudeRef Position: $Composite:GPSPosition #[TAIL]-- end -- 然后执行：\n也可对指定目录对所有文件进行遍历输出：\n1 exiftool -r -p format.fmt . 文件夹遍历 可以使用 -r 选项整个文件夹。如果想忽略某个子文件夹，可用 -i 选项排除。\n1 exiftool -r -FileName -i subfolder ~/Pictures 指定文件类型 使用 -ext 指定遍历的文件类型，--ext 排除遍历的文件类型。\n使用 - 选定，使用 -- 排除是 exiftool 中的通用做法。\n使用 if 寻找指定关键词的文件：\n1 exiftool -Filename -Subject -if \"\\$Subject eq 'Keyword'\" . 多语言 使用 -lang 选项查看支持的语言：\n1 2 3 4 5 6 ➜ exiftool -lang Available languages: en - English ... zh-cn - Simplified Chinese （简体中文） zh-tw - Traditional Chinese （繁體中文） 切换输出语言：\n1 exiftool -lang zh-cn img.png 选项文件 我们也可以将常用的选项放在一个文件中，然后使用 -@ args.txt将其选项内容读取。\n当然，你也可以在命令中添加其它选项。\n写入元数据 使用 -Tag=Value 的形式对元数据进行修改\nexiftool [OPTIONS] -TAG[+-\u003c]=[VALUE]... FILE... 可同时写入多个标签或多个文件：\n1 2 3 4 5 6 # 多标签写入 exiftool -Subject=Keyword \\ -Title=Title \\ -ImageDescription=Description image.png # 多文件写入 exiftool -Subject=Keyword *.png # 所以后缀为 png 的文件 增加关键词：\n1 2 exiftool -Subject='a' -Subject='b' image.png # 关键词重置为 a 和 b exiftool -Subject+='c' -o newfile.png -image.png # 添加关键词 c 并另存为 newfile.png 删除标签 在等号后留空值可删除对应标签。当使用 wildcard 时，使用 -a 选项确保所有组别的对应标签都已删除。\n1 2 exiftool .\\TestPic.jpg -GPSCoordinates= # 删除特定标签 exiftool .\\TestPic.jpg -GPS*= -a # 删除所有包含 GPS 的标签 选项顺序 选项顺序至关重要，exiftool 将从左到右对标签进行修改。因此需把删除的选项放最前面。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ## Writes a value to *ApertureValue* first, then deletes all of the exif tags, ## including *ApertureValue*. exiftool TestPic.jpg -ApertureValue=\"3.0\" -EXIF:all= ## Erases all of the tags in the exif group, then writes ## a new value to *ApertureValue*, which is a tag in the exif group. exiftool TestPic.jpg -EXIF:all= -ApertureValue=\"3.0\" 文件备份与复原 当对文件进行修改时，exiftool 将会自动生成备份文件filename_original.ext, 以下是几个关于备份文件的操作选项。\n-restore_original: 从备份文件还原\n-delete_original: 删除备份文件\n-overwrite_orignial: 避免生产备份文件\n1 2 3 4 exiftool -Subject=\"\" -overwrite_original image.png # 避免生产备份文件 exiftool -Subject=\"subject\" image.png # 该操作将生产备份文件 image_original.png exiftool -restore_original image.png # 复原备份文件 exiftool -delete_original image.png # 删除备份文件 元数据导出、导入、复制 参考：Metadata Sidecar Files\n从文件读取元数据 可以使用选项 -tagsFromFile SRCFILE 从文件中读取数据。\nCopy tag values from SRCFILE to FILE. Tag names on the command line after this option specify the tags to be copied, or excluded from the copy. Wildcards are permitted in these tag names. If no tags are specified, then all possible tags from the source file are copied to same-named tags in the preferred location of the output file (the same as specifying -all). More than one -tagsFromFile option may be used to copy tags from multiple files.\n在使用该选项时，选项后面的赋值将在选项拷贝完成后进行。例如下述命令的赋值顺序依次为：one, two, three, four.\n1 exiftool -One=1 -tagsFromFile s.jpg -Two -Four=4 -Three d.jpg 导出元数据文件 可以用 -tagsfromfile 或 -o 选项导出元数据，两者区别在于使用 -o 选项时，输出的文件必须是新文件，不能事先存在。 1 2 3 4 #Copy same-named tags from all information types to preferred locations in XMP: exiftool -tagsfromfile SRC.EXT DST.xmp # same effect as above, but the command will exit with an error if the output XMP file already exists exiftool SRC.EXT -o DST.xmp 可以使用 -all:all 选项确保写入的标签在相同的组别。 1 2 3 4 # Copy XMP, preserving original locations: exiftool -tagsfromfile SRC.EXT -all:all DST.xmp exiftool SRC.EXT -o DST.xmp -all:all 将 EXIF 和 IPTC 标签导入到 XMP 中。\n1 2 # Generate XMP from EXIF and IPTC using standard tag name mappings: exiftool -tagsfromfile SRC.EXT -@ exif2xmp.args -@ iptc2xmp.args DST.xmp 将 XMP 作为区块导出。这是将未知或只读标签导出到唯一方法。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 # Note that this will not deal with extended XMP segments in JPEG images if they exist. exiftool -tagsfromfile SRC.EXT -xmp DST.xmp # As with the previous command, this command will not copy extended XMP segments in JPEG images, but in this case the -a option may be added to also extract extended XMP blocks.

Multi-languages support should under-consideration. But I don't find a good solution until now. Therefore, I temporarily change the main langauge of the site as Chinese.\nHello, world! I'm so excited to write my first blog. In this blog, I wanna express the motivation of blogging, and also make a plan about what to write.\nWhy blogging As a programmer, shell is our best friend. We use command line to install packages, to compile and execute program. But at the most time, we cannot remember every command and also it is really common to meet error when execute command. We need external source to solve the problem. At that time, Google is our best friend. I really spend a lot of time in googling.\nWhen I first met the problem, Googling is the only option. But what about the second, third time? It's time to write solutions down as notes.\nIn what way should I keep notes? MS Word, LaTeX or markdown? MS Word is definitely not the option. LaTeX is powerful for processing math formula and writing beautiful articles, but too complicate to just for noting. So markdown is my choice.\nIn macOS, there are many note apps support markdown language, such as Ulysses, Bear and Typora. Ulysses and Bear are library-based apps, both of them support tagging and reference, easy for orginize notes. But they not support math symbol and not very flexible when writing code. Typora do support math and code well, but it is folder-based, means not support for tagging and reference.\nWhat if I edit my notes with typora, which support math and code well, and publish it to a website, which support reference and metadata like tags and categories.\nThat's the solution I am using now: typora + Hexo.\nWhy not write in Chinese The main reason is about communities. When I search for a solution, the results from Chinese communities are really poor.\nI won't discuss the poor internet environment of our country in this post. But the turth is that I add lr=lang_en to the url of googling to force the webpages returned are in English. It's really cool if when googling, my blogs are contained in the result. Only happens when I write in English. Moreover, there are many terms I don't know how to express in Chinese.\nThe second reason is to imporve my poor English writing. Hope someday I can ask questions and push issues on English community frequently.\nFinally, they are just my notes. I only need explain clear to myself. Typo is OK. Grammar err is OK. Take it easy!\nWhat to write Since It's my first blog, I really don't know how powerful Hexo is and what can I do with it. So I will rewirte this section after few weeks. But there are certain things I am sure to write.\nMy research and reading notes.\nWrite down the problem I meet and the solution of it.\nSetup of some useful tools. The next post I wanna to write is about raspberry pi.\nMake plan and set goals.\nMaybe some comment and complaint about our social.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Start Blogging","uri":"/life/start-blogging/"},{"categories":["study"],"content":"Note on Psychology Judgements rely on heuristics People’s judgments often rely on heuristics rather than on formal methods of analysis. Heuristics are informal rules of thumb that provide shortcuts, reducing the complexity of making judgments.\nAvailability heuristic is a judgment based on the information readily available in memory. It has two components. The first component is the relative ease or fluency with which you can retrieve information. The second component of availability is the content of memories you find easy to retrieve.\nRepresentativeness heuristic is a cognitive strategy that assigns an object to a category on the basis of a few characteristics regard as representative of that category. Research suggests that representative values often reflect an average of an event’s moment of peak intensity and the intensity at the event’s end.\nAnchoring heuristic is an insufficient adjustment up or down from an original starting value when judging the probable value of some event or outcome.\nAttribution for Success and Failure Attributions are judgments about the causes of outcomes. It can vary in three dimensions.\ninternal-external dimension: to what extent does a casual factor reside within an individual, or is it a general factor in the environment.\nstability-instability dimension: to what extent is a causal factor likely to be stable and consistent over time, or unstable and varying.\nglobal-specific dimension: to what extent is a causal factor highly specific, limited to a particular task or situation, or global, applying widely across a variety of settings.\nThe way people explain events in their lives—from winning at cards to being turned down for a date—can become lifelong, habitual attributional styles.\nThe optimistic attributional style sees failure as the result of external causes—“The test was unfair”—and of events that are unstable or modifiable and specific—“If I put in more effort next time, I’ll do better, and this one setback won’t affect how I perform any other task that is important to me.’’\nThe pessimistic attributional style focuses on the causes of failure as internally generated. Furthermore, the bad situation and the individual’s role in causing it are seen as stable and global—“It won’t ever change, and it will affect everything.” Because they believe themselves to be doomed to fail, pessimists perform worse than others would expect, given objective measures of their talent.\nIn academic settings, students who are more optimistic report higher levels of motivation.\nEmotion\nResearch suggests that good social relationships are the single most important source of happiness. Psychology and life Definition Psychology: The scientific study of the behavior of individuals and their mental processes. The goals of the psychologist conducting basic research are to describe, explain, predict, and control behavior.\nStructuralism(The Element of the Mind): The study of the structural of mind and behavior; the view that all human mental experience can be understood as a combination of simple elements or events.\nFunctionalism(Mind with a Purpose): The perspective on mind and behavior that focus on the examination of their functions in an organism’s interactions with the environment.\nPerspective on Psychology Psychodynamic perspective: A psychological model in which behavior is explained in term of past experience and motivational forces; actions are viewed as stemming from inherent instincts, biological drives, and attempts to resolve conflicts between personal needs and social requirements.\nBehaviorist perspective: The psychological perspective primarily concerned with observable behavior that can be objectively recorded and with the relationship of observable behavior that can be objectively recoded and with the relationships of observable behavior to environmental stimuli.\nHumanistic perspective: A psychological model that emphasizes an individuals’ phenomenal world and inherent capacity for making rational choices and developing to maximum potential.\nCognitive perspective: The perspective on psychology that stresses human though and the process of knowing, such as attending, thinking, remembering, expecting, solving problem, fantasizing, and consciousness.\nBiological perspective: The approach to identifying causes of behavior that focuses on the functioning of genes, the brain, the nervous system, and the endocrine system.\nEvolutionary perspective: The approach to psychology that stresses the importance of behavior and mental adaptiveness, based on the assumption that mental capabilities involved over millions of years to serve particular adaptive purposes.\nSociocultural perspective: The psychological perspective that focuses on cross-cultural differences in the causes and consequences of behavior.\nResearch methods in psychology Theory A theory is an organized set of concepts that explains a phenomenon or set of phenomenon. Psychological theories commonly include the assumption of determinism, the doctrine that all events—physical, behavioral, and mental—are determined by specific causal factors that are potentially knowable. Researchers also assume that behavior and mental processes follow lawful patterns of relationships, patterns that can be discovered and revealed through research\nCombat biases Standardization: A set of uniform procedures for treating each participant in a test, interview, or experiment, or for recording data. Operational definition: A definition of a variable or condition in terms of the specific operation or procedure used to determine its presence.\nExperimental Methods double-blind control: An experimental technique in which biased expectations of experimenters are eliminated by keeping both participants and experimental assistants unaware of which participants have received which treatment.\nbetween-subject design: A research design in which different group of participants are randomly assigned to experimental conditions or to control conditions.\nwithin-subject design: A research design that uses each participant as his or her own control; for example, the behavior of an experimental participant before receiving treatment might be compared to his or her behavior after receiving treatment.\nPsychological Measurement Goal: generate findings that are both reliable and valid Reliability: The degree to which a test produces similar scores each time it is used; stability or consistency of the scores produced by an instrument. Validity: The extent to which a test measures what it was intended to measure.\nSelf-report measure: A self-behavior that is identified through a participant’s own observations and reports.\nbehavioral measure: Overt actions or reactions that is observed and recorded, exclusive of self-report behavior.\nStatistical Supplement significant difference: A difference between experimental groups or conditions that would have occurred by chance less than an accepted criterion; in psychology, the criterion most often used is a probability of less than 5 times out of 100, or p\u003c.05\nThe Biological and Evolutionary Bases of Behavior Heredity and Behavior Main point\nSpecies originate and change over time because of natural selection In the evolution of humans, bipedalism and encephalization were responsible for subsequent advances, including language and culture. The basic unit of heredity is the gene. Genes interact with environments to yield phenotypic traits. Key terms\ngenotype（基因型）: The genetic structure an organism inherits from its parents.\nphenotype（表型）: The observable characteristics of an organism, resulting from the interaction between organism’s genotype and its environment.\nheredity（遗传）: The biological transmission of traits from parents to offspring.\ngenetics（遗传学）: The study of the inheritance of physical and psychological traits from ancestors.\nhuman behavior genetics（人类行为遗传学）: The area of study that evaluates the genetic component of individual differences in behavior and traits.\nsociobiology（社会生物学）: A field of research that focuses on evolutionary explanations for the social behavior and social systems of humans and other animal species.\nevolutionary psychology（进化心理学）: The study of behavior and mind using the principles of evolutionary theory.\nDNA(deoxyribonucleic acid): The physical basis for the transmission of genetic information.\ngene（基因）: The biological unit of heredity; discretion section of a chromosome responsible for transmission of traits.\ngenome（基因组）: The genetic information for an organism, stored in the DNA of its chromosomes（染色体）.\nheritability（遗传力）: The relative influence of genetics—versus environment—in determining patterns of behavior.\nThe Nervous System in Action neuroscience: The scientific study of the brain and of the links between brain activity and behavior. The Neuron Main Point\nThe neuron, the basic unit of the nervous system, receives, processes, and relays information to other cells, glands, and muscles. Neurons relay information from the dendrites through the cell body (soma) to the axon to the terminal buttons. Sensory neurons receive messages from specialized receptor cells and send them toward the CNS. Motor neurons direct messages from the CNS to muscles and glands. Interneurons relay information from sensory neurons to other interneurons or to motor neurons. Mirror neurons respond when an individual observes another individual performing a motor action. Term\nneuron structure\nneuron（神经元）: A cell in the nervous system specialized to receive, process, and/or transmit information to other cells. dendrite（树突）: One of the branched fibers of neurons that receive incoming signals. soma（胞体）: The cell body of a neuron, containing the nucleus and cytoplasm. axon（轴突）: The extended fiber of a neuron through which nerve impulses travel from the soma to the terminal buttons. terminal button（终扣）: A bulblike structure at the branched ending of an axon that contains vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. type of neuron\nsensory neuron（感觉神经元）: Neuron that carries messages from sense receptors toward the central nervous system. motor neuron（运动神经元）: Neuron that carries messages away from the central nervous system toward the muscles and glands. interneuron（中间神经元）: Brain neuron that relays messages from sensory neurons to other interneurons or to motor neurons. mirror neuron: Neuron that responds when an individual observes another individual performing a motor action. It may enable us to understand the intentions of other people’s behavior. other cell and material\nglia（胶质）: The cells that hold neurons together and facilitate neural transmission, remove damaged and dead neurons, and prevent poisonous substances in the blood from reaching the brain. myelin sheath（髓鞘）: Insulating material that surrounds axons and increases the speed of neural transmission. Glial cells form an myelin sheath. Action Potentials Main points\nOnce the summation of inputs to a neuron exceeds a specific threshold, an action potential is sent along the axon to the terminal buttons. All-or-none action potentials are created when the opening of ion channels allows an exchange of ions across the cell membrane. Terms\nexcitatory input（兴奋性输入）: Information entering a neuron that signals it to fire. inhibitory input（抑制性输入）: Information entering a neuron that signals it not to fire. action potential（动作电位）: The nerve impulse activated in a neuron that travels down the axon and causes neurotransmitters to released into a synapse. resting potential（静息电位）: The polarization of cellular fluid within a neuron, which provides the capability to produce an action potential. ion channel（离子通道）: A portion of neurons’ cell membranes that selectively permits certain ions to flow in and out. all-or-none law（全或无定律）: The rule that the size of the action potential is unaffected by increases in the intensity of stimulation beyond the threshold level. refractory period（不应期）: The period of rest during which a new nerve impulse cannot be activated in a segment of an axon. Process of action potentials\nWhen neuron is inactive, there is more potassium inside and sodium outside the axon. Sodium-potassium pumps leaves the fluid inside a neuron with a slightly negative voltage (70/1,000 of a volt) relative to the fluid outside. Excitatory inputs causes the ion channels to begin to allow sodium ions to flow in while inhibitory inputs causes the ion channels to work harder to keep the inside of the cell negatively charged. An action potential begins when excitatory inputs are strong enough to depolarize cell from -70mV to -55mV. Once happened, sodium rushes into the neuron. The leading edge of depolarize causes ion channels in the adjacent region of the axon to open and allow sodium to rush in, causing the signal passes down the axon. When the inside of the neuron becomes positive, the channels that allow sodium to flow in close and the channels that allow potassium to flow out open. The outflow of potassium ions restores the negative charge of the neuron. Sodium-potassium pumps works again to restore the concentration of sodium and potassium. Synaptic Transmission Main point\nNeurotransmitters are released into the synaptic gap between neurons. Once they diffuse across the gap, they lodge in the receptor molecules of the postsynaptic membrane. Whether these neurotransmitters excite or inhibit the membrane depends on the nature of the receptor molecule. Terms\nsynapse（突触）: The gap between one neuron and another. synaptic transmission（突触传递）: The relaying of information from one neuron to another across the synaptic gap. neurotransmitter（神经递质）: Chemical messenger released from a neuron that crosses the synapse from one neuron to another, stimulating the postsynaptic neuron. neuromodulator（神经调质）: Any substance that modifies or modulates the activities of the postsynaptic neuron. Process of synaptic transmission\nWhen the action potential arrive at the terminal button, synaptic vesicles move toward and affix themselves to the interior membrane of the terminal button. Lon channels open to allow calcium ions into the terminal button, which causes the rupture of the synaptic vesicles and the release of whatever neurotransmitters they contain. Neurotransmitters are dispersed rapidly across the synaptic cleft, the gap between the terminal button of one neuron and the cell membrane of the next. The neurotransmitter attach to receptor molecules embedded in the postsynaptic membrane only under certain condition. The neurotransmitter provide ‘fire’ or ‘not fire’ information to this next neuron. Once the neurotransmitter completed its job. it detaches from the receptor molecule and drifts back into the synaptic gap. It is either decomposed through the action of enzymes or reabsorbed into the presynaptic terminal button for quick reuse.

Sensory Knowledge of the world The task of perception is to determine what the distal (external) stimulus is from the information contained in the proximal (sensory) stimulus. Psychophysics investigates psychological responses to physical stimuli. Researchers measure absolute thresholds and just noticeable differences between stimuli. Signal detection allows researchers to separate sensory acuity from response biases. Researchers in psychophysics have captured the relationship between physical intensity and psychological effect. Sensation translates the physical energy of stimuli into neural codes via transduction. distal stimulus（远距刺激）: In the processes of perception, the physical object in the world, as contrasted with the proximal stimulus, the optical image on the retina.\nproximal stimulus（近距刺激）: The optical image on the retina; contrasted with the distal stimulus, the physical object in the world.\npsychophysics（心理物理学）: The study of the correspondence between physical simulation and psychological experience.\nabsolute threshold（绝对阈限）: The minimum amount of physical energy needed to produce a reliable sensory experience; operationally defined as the stimulus level at which a sensory signal is detected half the time.\npsychometric function（心理测量函数）: A graph that plots the percentage of detections of a stimulus(on the vertical axis) for each stimulus intensity(on the horizon axis).\nsensory adaptation（感觉适应）: A phenomenon in which receptor cell lose their power to respond after a period of unchanged stimulation; allows a more rapid reaction to new sources of information.\nresponse bias（反应偏差）: The systematic tendency as a result of non-sensory factors for an observer to favor responding in a particular way.\nsignal detection theory（信号检测论）: A systematic approach to the problem of response bias that allow an experimenter to identify and separate the roles of sensory stimuli and the individual’s criterion level in producing the final response.\ndifference threshold（差别阈限）: The smallest physical difference between two stimuli that can still be recognized as a difference; operationally defined as the point at which the stimuli are recognized as different half of the time.\njust noticeable difference(JND, 最小可觉差）:The smallest difference between two sensations that allows them to be discriminated.\nWeber’s law（韦伯定律）: An assertion that the size of a difference threshold is proportional to the intensity of the standard stimulus.\ntransduction（换能）: Transformation of one form of energy into another; for example, light is transformed into neutral impulses.\nsensory receptor（感受器）: Specialized cell that converts physical signals into cellular signals that are processed by the nervous system.\nThe Visual System Photoreceptors in the retina, called rods and cones, convert light energy into neural impulses. Ganglion cells in the retain integrate input from receptors and bipolar cells. Their axons form the optic nerves that meet at the optic chiasma. Visual information is distributed to several different areas of the brain that process different aspects of the visual environment, such as how things look and where they are. The wavelength of light is the stimulus for color. Color sensations differ in hue, saturation, and brightness. Color vision theory combines the trichromatic theory of three color receptors with the opponent-process theory of color systems composed of opponent elements. pupil（瞳孔）: The opening at the front of the eye through which light passes. lens（晶状体）: The flexible tissue that focuses light on the retina. accommodation（调节）: The process by which the ciliary muscles changes the thickness of the lens of the eye to permit variable focusing on near and distant objects. retina（视网膜）: The layer at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptors and converts light energy to neutral responses. photoreceptor（光感受器）: Receptor cell in the retina that is sensitive to light. rod（杆体细胞）: One of the photoreceptors concentrated in the periphery of the retina that are most active in dim illumination; rods do not produce sensation of color. cone（锥体细胞）: One of the photoreceptors concentrated in the center of the retina that are responsible for visual experience under normal viewing conditions for all experiences of color. dark adaptation （暗适应）: The gradual improvement of the eyes’ sensitivity after a shift in illumination from light to near darkness. fovea （中央凹）: Area of the retina that contains densely packed cones and forms the point of sharpest vision. bipolar cell （双极细胞）: Nerve cell in the visual system that combines impulses from many receptors and transmits the results to ganglion cells. ganglion cell （神经节细胞）: Cell in the visual system that integrates impulses from many bipolar cells in a single firing rate. horizontal cell （水平细胞）: One of the cells that integrates information across the retina; rather than sending signals toward the brain, horizontal cells connect receptors to each other. amacrine cell（无长突细胞）: One of the cells that integrates information across the retina; rather than sending signals toward the brain, amacrine cells link bipolar cells to other bipolar cells and ganglion cells to other ganglion cells. blind spot（盲点）: The region of the retina where the optic nerve leaves the back of the eye; no receptor cells are present in this region. optic nerve（视神经）: The axons of the ganglion cells that carry information from the eye toward the brain. receptive field（感受野）: The area of the visual field to which a neuron in the visual system responds. hue（色调）: The dimension of color space that captures the qualitative experience of the color of light. saturation（饱和度）: The dimension of color space that captures the purity and vividness of color sensations. brightness（明度）: The dimension of color space that captures the intensity of light. complementary colors（互补色）: Colors opposite each other on the color circle; when additively mixed, they create the sensation of white light. trichromatic theory（三原色原理）: The theory that there are three types of color receptors that produce the primary color sensations of red, green, and blue. opponent-process theory（拮抗加工理论）: The theory that all color experiences arise from three systems, each of which includes two ‘’opponent’’ elements (red versus green, blue versus yellow, and black versus white). Hearing Hearing is produced by sound waves that vary in frequency, amplitude, and complexity. In the cochlea, sound waves are transformed into fluid waves that move the basilar membrane. Hairs on the basilar membrane stimulate neural impulses that are sent to the auditory cortex. Place theory best explains the coding of high frequencies, and frequency theory best explains the coding of low frequencies. To compute the direction from which sound is arriving, two types of neural mechanisms compute the relative intensity and timing of sounds coming to each ear. pitch（音高）: Sound quality of highness or lowness; primarily dependent on the frequency of the sound wave.\nloudness（响度）: A perceptual dimension of sound influenced by the amplitude of a sound wave; sound waves in large amplitudes are generally experienced as loud and those with small amplitudes as soft.\ntimbre （音色）: The dimension of auditory sensation that reflects the complexity of a sound wave.\ncochlea（耳蜗）: The primary organ of hearing; a fluid-filled coiled tube located in the inner ear.\nbasilar membrane（基底膜）: A membrane in the cochlea that, when set into motion, stimulates hair cells that produce the neural effect of auditory stimulation.\nauditory nerve（听神经）: The nerve that carries impulses form the cochlea to the cochlear nucleus of the brain\nplace theory（地点说）: The theory that different frequency tones produce maximum activation at different locations along the basilar membrane, with the result that pitch can be coded by the place at which activation occurs.\nfrequency theory（频率说）: The theory that a tone produces a rate of vibration in the basilar membrane equal to its frequency, with the result that pitch can be coded by the frequency of the neural response.\nvolley principle（齐射原理）: An extension of frequency theory, which proposes that when peaks in a sound wave come too frequently for a single neuron to fire at each peak, several neurons fire as a group at the frequency of the stimulus tone.\nsound localization（声音定位）: The auditory processes that allow the spatial origins of environmental sounds.\nYour other senses Smell and taste respond to the chemical properties of substances and work together when people are seeking and sampling food. Olfaction is accomplished by odor-senstive cells deep in the nasal passages. Test receptors are test buds embedded in papillae, mostly in the tongue. The cutaneous(skin) senses give sensations of pressure and temperature. The vestibular sense gives information about the direction and rate of body motion. The kinesthetic sense gives information about the position of body parts and helps coordinate motion. Pain is the body’s response to potentially harmful stimuli. The physiological response to pain involves sensory response at the site of the pain stimulus and nerve impulses moving between the brain and the spinal cord. olfaction（嗅觉）: The sense of smell. olfactory bulb（嗅球）: The center where odor-sensitive receptors send their signals, located just below the frontal lobes of the cortex. pheromone（信息素）: Chemical signal released by an organism to communicate with other members of species; pheromone often serve as long-distance sexual attractors. gustation（味觉）: The sense of taste. cutaneous senses（肤觉）: The skin senses that register sensations of pressure, warmth, and cold. vestibular sense（前庭觉）: The sense that tells how one’s own body is oriented in the world with respect to gravity. kinesthetic sense（动觉）: The sense concerned with bodies position and movement of body parts relative to one another. pain（痛觉）: The body’s response to noxious stimuli that are intense enough to cause, or threaten to cause, tissue damage. gate-control theory（门控理论）: A theory about pain modulaiton that proposes that certain cells in the spinal cord act as gates to interrupt and block some pain signals while sending others to the brain. Organizational processes in perception Perceptual processes organize sensations into coherent images and give you perception of objects and patterns. Both your personal goals and the properties of the objects in the world determine where you will focus your attention. The Gestalt psychologists provided several laws of perceptual grouping, including proximity, similarity, good continuation, closure, and common fate. Perceptual processes integrate over both time and space to provide an interpretation of the environment. Binocular, motion, and pictorial cues all contribute to the perception of depth. You tend to perceive objects as having stable size, shape, and lightness. Knowledge about perceptual illusions can provide constraints on ordinary perceptual processes. Attention Processes\nattention（注意）: A state of focused awareness on a subset of the available perceptual information.\ngoal-directed attention（目标指向）: A determinant of why people select some parts of sensory input for further processing; it reflects the choices made as a function of one’s own goals.\nstimulus-driven attention（刺激驱动）: A determinant of why people select some parts of sensory input for further processing; occurs when features of stimuli –– objects in the environment –– automatically capture attentions, independent of the local goals of a perceiver.\nGestalt psychology（格式塔心理学）: A school of psychology that maintains that psychological phenomena can be understood only when viewed as organized, structured wholes, not when broken down into primitive perceptual elements.\nphi phenomenon(phi 现象）: The simplest form of apparent motion, the movement illusion in which one or more stationary lights going on and off in succession are perceived as a single moving light.\nDepth Perception\nbinocular depth cue（双眼深度线索）: Depth cue that uses information from both eyes. retinal disparity（视网膜像差）: The displacement between the horizontal positions of corresponding images in the two eyes. convergence（视轴辐合）: The degree to which the eyes turn inward to fixate on an object. motion parallax（运动视差）: A source of information about depth in which the relative distances of objects from a viewer determine the amount and direction of their relative motion in the retinal image. monocular depth cue（单眼深度线索）: Depth cue that uses information from only one eye. perceptual constancy （知觉恒常性：The ability to retain an unchanging percept of an object despite variations in the retinal image. size constancy（大小恒常性）: The ability to perceive the true size of an object despite variations in the size of its retinal image. shape constancy（形状）: The ability to perceive the true shape of an object despite variations in the shape of the retinal image. lightness constancy（亮度恒常性）: The tendency to perceive the whiteness, grayness, or blackness of object as constant across changing levels of illumination. illusion（错觉）: An experience of a stimulus pattern in a manner that is demonstrably incorrect but shared by others in the same perceptual environment. Identification and Recognition processes During the final stage of perceptual processing –– identification and recognition of objects –– percepts are given meaning through processes that combine bottom-up and top-down influences. Ambiguity may rise when the same sensory information can be organized into different percepts. Context, exceptions, and perceptual sets may guide recognition of incomplete or ambiguous data in one direction rather than another equally possible one. bottom-up processing（自下而上加工）: Perceptual analyses based on the sensory data available in the environment; results of analysis are passed upward toward more abstract representations. top-down processing （自上而下加工）: Perceptual processes in which information from an individual’s past experience, knowledge, expectations, motivations, and background influence the way a perceived object is interpreted and classified. ambiguity（模糊性）: Property of perceptual object that may have more than one interpretation. set（定势）: A temporary readiness to perceive or react to a stimulus in a particular way. Mind, Consciousness, and Alternate States The Contents of Consciousness Consciousness is an awareness of the mind’s contents. The contents of waking consciousness contrast with non-conscious processes, preconscious memories, unattended information, the unconscious, and conscious awareness. Research techniques such as think-aloud protocols and experience sampling are used to study the contents of consciousness. consciousness（意识）: A state of awareness of internal events and the external environment. non-conscious（非意识）: Not typically available to consciousness or memory. preconscious memory（前意识记忆）: Memory that is not currently conscious but that can easily be called into consciousness when necessary. in-attentional blindness: Peoples’s failure to perceive objects when their attention is focused elsewhere. The Functions of Consciousness Consciousness aids your survival. Consciousness reduces the flow of stimulus input by restricting what you notice and what you focus on. Consciousness allow you to selectively store information. Consciousness can make you stop, think, and consider alternative based on past knowledge and imagine various consequences. Consciousness enables you to construct both personal and culturally shared realities. Personal construction of reality is your unique interpretation of a current situation based on your general knowledge, memories of past experiences, current needs, values, beliefs, and future goals. Cultural construction of reality are ways of thinking about the world that are shared by most members of a particular group of people. Sleep and Dreams Circadian rhythms reflect the operation of a biological clock. Patters of brain activity change over the course of a night’s sleep. REM sleep is signaled by rapid eye movements. If someone is routinely made to perform at times of day that are out of sync with his personal rhythms, he is suffer from a type of “social jet lag”, which has a negative impact on both achievement and behavior. The amount of sleep and relative proportion of REM to NERM sleep change with age. The amount of REM sleep decreases considerably over the year while NREM diminishes less sharply. REM and NREM sleep serve different functions, including conservation of energy and consolidation of new memories . Sleep disorders such as insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea have a negative impact on people’s ability to function during waking time. Freud proposed that the content of dreams is unconscious material slipped by a sleeping censor. In other cultures, dreams are interpreted regularly, often by people with special cultural roles. Some dream theories have focused on biological explanations for the origins of dreams. Studies confirmed that the content of dreams show a good deal of continuity with dreamers’ waking concerns. Dreams also show a dream-lag effect: they are more likely to include memory elements from the period 5-7 days before the dream rather than 2-4 days before. Lucid dreaming is an awareness that one is dreaming. circadian rhythm（生理节律）: A consistent pattern of cyclical body activities, usually lasting 24-25 hours and determined by an internal biological clock.\nrapid eye movements(REM, 快速眼动睡眠）: A behavior sign of the phase of sleep during which the sleeper is likely to be experiencing dreamlike mental activity.\nnon-REM(NREM) sleep（非快速眼动睡眠）: The period during which a sleeper does not show rapid eye movement; characterized by less dream activity than during REM sleep.\ninsomnia（失眠症）: The chronic inability to sleep normally; symptoms include difficulty in falling asleep, frequent waking, inability to return to sleep, and early-morning awakening.\nnarcolepsy（发作性睡眠症）: A sleep disorder characterized by an irresistible compulsion to sleep during the daytime.\nsleep apnea（睡眠窒息）: A sleep disorder of the upper respiratory system that causes the person to stop breathing while asleep.\nsomnambulism（梦游症）: A disorder that causes sleepers to leave their beds and wander while still remaining asleep; also known as sleepwalking.\nnightmare（梦靥）: A frightening dream that usually wakes up the sleeper.\nsleep terrors（夜惊）: Episodes in which sleepers wake up suddenly in an extreme state of arousal and panic.\nlatent content（潜性梦境）: In Freudian dream analysis, the hidden meaning of a dream.\nmanifest content（显性梦境）: In Freudian dream analysis, the surface content of a dream, which is assumed to mask the dream’s actual meaning.\ndream work: In Freudian dream analysis, the process by which the internal censor transforms the latent content of a dream into manifest content.\nlucid dreaming（清醒梦境）: The theory that conscious awareness of dreaming is a learnable skill that enables dreamers to control the direction and content of their dreams.\nAltered States of Consciousness Hypnosis is an alternate state of consciousness characterized by the ability of hypnotizable people to change perception, motivation, memory and self-control response to suggestions. Hypnotizability is a relatively stable attribute which peaks just before adolescence and declines thereafter. Meditation changes conscious functioning by ritual practices that focus attention away from external concerns to inner experience. hypnosis（催眠）: An altered state of awareness characterized by deep relaxation, susceptibility to suggestions, and changes in perception, memory, motivation, and self-control. hypnotizability（可催眠性）: The degree to which an individual is responsive to standardized hypnotic suggestion. meditation（冥想）: A form of consciousness alteration designed to enhance self-knowledge and well-being through reduced self-awareness. Mind-Altering Drugs Psychoactive drugs affect mental processes by temporarily changing consciousness as they modify nervous system activity. Among psychoactive drug that alter consciousness are hallucinogens, opiates, depressants, and stimulants. Hallucinogenic drugs typically act in the brain by affecting the use of the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin. Cannabis’（大麻） active ingredient cannabinoids（大麻素） achieve their mind-altering effects by binding to brain sites sensitive to naturally occurring substances in the brain. Opiates（鸦片）, such as heroin and morphine, suppress physical sensation and response to stimulation. The depressants include barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and alcohol. These substances tend to depress (slow down) the mental and physical activity of the body by inhibiting or decreasing the transmission of nerve impulses in the central nervous system. Stimulants, such as amphetamines, methamphetamines, and cocaine, keep the drug user aroused and induce states of euphoria. Stimulants achieve their effects by increasing the brain levels of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. psychoactive drug（精神促动药物）: Chemical that affects mental processes and behavior by temporarily changing conscious awareness of reality. tolerance（耐受性）: A situation that occurs with continued use of a drug in which an individual requires greater dosages to achieve the same effect. physiological dependence（生理依赖）: The process by which the body becomes adjust to or dependent on a drug. addiction（成瘾）: A condition in which the body requires a drug in order to function without physical and psychological reactions to its absence; often the outcome of tolerance and dependence. psychological dependence（心理依赖）: The psychological need or craving for a drug. hallucinogen（迷幻剂）: Drug that alters cognitions and perceptions and causes hallucinations. depressant（镇静剂）: Drug that depresses or slows down the activity of the central nervous system. Stimulant（兴奋剂）: Drug that causes arousal, increased activity, and euphoria. Learning and Behavior Analysis The Study of Learning Learning（学习） is a process based on experience that results in a relatively consistent change in behavior or behavior potential. Learning-performance distinction（学习 - 行为表现差异） is the difference between what has been learned and what is expressed, or performed, in overt behavior. It occurs because of behavior potential. Habituation and sensitization are examples of learning. Behavior analysis（行为分析） is the area of psychology that focuses on the environment determinants of learning and behavior. habituation（习惯化）: A decrease in a behavioral response when a stimulus is presented repeatedly. sensitization（敏感化）: A increase in a behavioral response when a stimulus is presented repeatedly. Recapping Main Points\nLearning entails a relatively consistent change in behavior or behavior potential based on experience. Behaviorists believe that much behavior can be explained by simple learning processes. They also believe that many of the same principles of learning apply to all organisms. Classical Conditioning: Learning Predictable Signals Classical conditioning（经典条件作用） is a type of learning in which a behavior(conditioned response) comes to be elicited by a stimulus(conditioned stimulus) that has acquired its power through an association with a biologically significant stimulus (unconditioned stimulus) A reflex is an unconditioned response elicited by unconditioned stimulus. Conditioning is usually most effective in a delayed conditioning paradigm(i.e. CS happens immediately after UCS stops.), with a short interval between the onsets of the CS and UCS. The process of extinction and spontaneous recovery occurs when the CS no longer predicts the UCS after classical conditioning acquisition. acquisition（习得）: The stage in a classical conditioning experiment during which the conditioned response is first elicited by the conditioned stimulus. extinction（消退）: In conditioning, the weakening of a conditioned association in the absence of a reinforcer or unconditioned stimulus. spontaneous recovery（自发恢复）: The reappearance of an extinguished conditioned response after a rest period. To the new stimulus similar to the original CS, both stimulus discrimination and discrimination may occur to make sure an organism not to be either over-selective or over-responsive to stimulus. stimulus generalization（刺激泛化）: The automatic extension of conditioned responding to similar stimuli that have never been paired with the unconditioned stimulus. stimulus discrimination（刺激辨别）: A conditioning process in which an organism learns to respond differently to stimuli that diff from the conditioned stimulus on some dimension. A neutral stimulus will become an effective CS only if it is both appropriately contingent and informative. Contingent means CS must be reliably predict the occurrence of the UCS. Informative means the stimulus is intense and contrasts with other stimuli. In the context of drug addiction, tolerance arises because the settings under taking drug acts as CS and elicit compensatory response which reduces the effect of drug. Taste-aversion learning is a biological constraint on learning in which an organism learns in one trail to avoid a food whose ingestion is followed by illness. It will develop with only one pairing of the CS and UCS and with a long lag between the CS and UCS. It will often be permanent after one experience. Recapping Main Points\nIn classical conditioning, first investigated by Pavlov, an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) elicits an unconditioned response (UCR). A neutral stimulus paired with the UCS becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS), which elicits a response, called the conditioned response (CR). Extinction occurs when the UCS no longer follows the CS. Stimulus generalization is the phenomenon whereby stimuli similar to the CS elicit the CR. Discrimination learning narrows the range of CSs to which an organism responds. For classical conditioning to occur, a contingent and informative relationship must exist between the CS and UCS. Classical conditioning explains many emotional responses and drug tolerance. Taste-aversion learning suggests that species are genetically prepared for some forms of associations. reflex（反射）: An unlearned response elicited by specific stimuli that have biological relevance for an organism. unconditioned stimulus(UCS, 无条件刺激）: In classical conditioning, the stimulus that elicits an unconditioned response. unconditioned response(UCR, 无条件反应）: In classical conditioning, the response elicited by an unconditioned stimulus without prior training or learning. conditioned stimulus(CS, 条件刺激）: In classical conditioning, a previously neutral stimulus that comes to elicit a conditioned response. conditioned response(CR, 条件反应）: In classical conditioning, a response elicited by some previously neutral stimulus that occurs as a result of pairing the neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus. Operant Conditioning: Learning about Consequences As with classical conditioning, spontaneous recovery is also a feature of operant conditioning. The sequence of discriminative stimulus-behavior-consequence as the three-term contingency. Organisms also generalize responses to other stimuli that resemble the discriminative stimulus. It is advised that parents first try positive reinforcement rather than punishment. According to respond deprivation theory, behaviors become preferred and, therefore, reinforcing when an animal is prevented from engaging in them. That’s why virtually any activity can come to serve as a reinforcer. Recapping Main Points\nThorndike demonstrated that behaviors that bring about satisfying outcomes tend to be repeated. Skinner’s behavior analytic approach centers on manipulating contingencies of reinforcement and observing the effects on behavior. Behaviors are made more likely by positive and negative reinforcement. They are made less likely by positive and negative punishment. Contextually appropriate behavior is explained by the three-term contingency of discriminative stimulus-behavior-consequence. Primary reinforces are stimuli that function as reinforcers even when an organism has not had previous experience with them. Conditioned reinforcers are acquired by association with primary reinforcers. Probable activities function as positive reinforcers. Behavior is affected by schedules of reinforcement that may be varied or fixed and delivered in intervals or in ratios. Complex responses may be learned through shaping. Instinctual drift may overwhelm some response-reinforcement learning. law of effect（效果律）: a basic law of learning that states that the power of a stimulus to evoke a response is strengthened when the response is followed by a reward and weakened when it is not followed by a reward.\noperant conditioning（操作性条件作用）: Learning in which the probability of a response is changed by a change in its consequences.\noperant（操作）: Behavior emitted by an organism that can be characterized in term of the observable effects it has on the environment.\nreinforcement contingency（强化相倚）: A consistent relationship between a response and the changes in the environment that it produces.\nreinforcer（强化物）: Any stimulus that, when made contingent on a response, increases the probability of that response.\npositive reinforcement（正强化）: A behavior is followed by the presentation of an appetitive stimulus. negative reinforcement（负强化）: A behavior is followed by the removal of an aversive stimulus. escape conditioning（逃脱作用）: A form of learning in which animals acquire a response that will allow them to escape from an aversive stimulus. avoidance conditioning（回避作用）: A form of learning in which animals acquire responses that allow them to avoid aversive stimuli before they begin. operant extinction（操作性消退）: When a behavior no longer produces predictable consequences, its return to the level of occurrence it had before operant conditioning.\npunisher（惩罚物）: Any stimulus that, when made contingent on a response, decreases the probability of that response.\npositive punishment（阳性惩罚）: A behavior is followed by the presentation of an aversive stimulus. negative punishment（阴性惩罚）: A behavior is followed by the removal of an appetitive stimulus. discriminative stimulus（辨别性刺激）: Stimulus that acts as a predictor of reinforcement, signaling when particular behaviors will result in positive reinforcement.\nthree-term contingency（三项相倚）: The means by which organisms learn that, in the presence of some stimuli but not others, their behavior is likely to have a particular effect on their environment.\nprimary reinforcer（初级强化物）: Biologically determined reinforcer, such as food and water.\nconditioned reinforcer（条件性强化物）: In classical conditioning, a formerly neutral stimulus that has become a reinforcer.

Research suggests that children who observe a large number of aggressive acts may learn to be aggressive themselves. Recapping Main Points\nSome forms of learning reflect more complex processes than those of classical or operant conditioning. Animals develop cognitive maps to enable them to function in a complex environment. Other species may be able to encode concepts such as same versus different. Behaviors can be vicariously reinforced or punished. Humans and other animals can learn through observation. comparative cognition（比较认知）: The study of the development of cognitive abilities across species and the continuity of abilities from nonhuman to human animals. cognitive map（认知地图）: A mental representation of physical space. observation learning（观察学习）: The process of learning new responses by watching the behavior of another. Memory What is Memory Cognitive psychologists study memory as a type of information processing. Memory involving conscious effort are explicit. Unconscious memories are implicit. Declarative memory is memory for facts; procedural memory is memory for how to perform skills. Memory is often viewed as a three-stage process of encoding, storage, and retrieval. memory（记忆）: The mental capacity to encode, store, and retrieve information. explicit uses of memory（记忆的外显作用）: Conscious effort to encode or recover information through memory processes. implicit uses of memory（记忆到内隐作用）: Availability of information through memory processes without conscious effort to encode or recover information. declarative memory（陈述性记忆）: Memory for information such as facts and events. Explicit and implicit memories are all declarative memories. procedural memory（程序性记忆）: Memory for how things get done; the way perceptual, cognitive, and motor skills are acquired, retained, and used. encoding（编码）: The process by which a mental representation is formed in memory. storage（存储）: The retention of encoded material over time. retrieval（提取）: The recovery of stored information from memory. Memory Use for the Short Term Iconic memory has large capacity but very short duration. Short-term memory(STM) has a limited capacity and lasts only briefly without rehearsal. Maintenance rehearsal can extend the presence of material in STM indefinitely. STM capacity can be increased by chunking unrelated items into meaningful groups. The broader concept of working memory includes STM. The four components of working memory provide the resources for moment-by-moment experiences of the world. iconic memory（映像记忆）: Memory system in the visual domain that allows large amounts of information to be stored for very brief durations. short-term memory(STM, 短时记忆）: Memory processes associated with preservation of recent experiences and with retrieval of information from long-term memory; short-term memory is of limited capacity and stores information for only a short length of time without rehearsal. chunking（组块）: The process of taking single items of information and recording them on the basis of similarity or some other organizing principle. working memory（工作记忆）: A memory resource that is used to accomplish tasks such as reasoning and language comprehension; consists of the phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad, central executive and episodic buffer. Long-Term Memory: Encoding and Retrieval Long-term memory (LTM) constitutes your total knowledge of the world and of yourself. It is nearly unlimited in capacity. Your ability to remember information relies on the match between circumstances of encoding and retrieval. Retrieval cues allow you to access information in LTM. Episodic memory is concerned with memory for events that have been personally experienced. Semantic memory is memory for the basic meaning of words and concepts. Similarity in context between learning and retrieval aids retrieval. The serial position curve is explained by distinctiveness in context. Information processed more deeply is typically remembered better. For implicit memories, it is important that the processes of encoding and retrieval be similar. Ebbinghaus studied the time course of forgetting. Interference occurs when retrieval cues do not lead uniquely to specific memories. Memory performance can be improved through elaborative rehearsal and mnemonics. In general, feelings-of-knowing accurately predict the availability of information in memory. long-term memory(LTM, 长时记忆）: Memory processes associated with the preservation of information for retrieval at any later time. retrieval cue（提取线索）: Internally or externally generated stimulus available to help with the retrieval of a memory. recall（回忆）: A method of retrieval in which an individual is required to reproduce the information previously presented. recognition（再认）: A method of retrieval in which an individual is required to identify stimuli as having been experienced before. episodic memory（情景记忆）: Long-term memory for an autobiographical event and the context in which it occurred. semantic memory（语义记忆）: Generic, categorical memory, such as the meaning of words and concepts. encoding specificity（编码特异性）: The principle that subsequent retrieval of information is enhanced if cues received at the time of recall are consistent with those present at the time of encoding. serial position effect（系列位置效应）: A characteristic of memory retrieval in which the recall of beginning and end items on a list is often better than recall of items appearing in the middle. primacy effect（首因效应）: Improved memory for items at the start of a list. recency effect（近因效应）: Improved memory for items at the end of a list. temporal distinctiveness: The extent to which a particular item stands out from or is distinct from other items in time. transfer-appropriate processing（传输适宜性加工）: The perspective that suggests that memory is best when the type of processing carried out at encoding matches the processes carried out at retrieval. levels-of-processing theory（加工水平理论）: A theory that suggests that the deeper the level at which information was processed, the more likely it is to be retained in memory. priming（启动）: In the assessment of implicit memory, the advantage conferred by prior exposure to a word or situation. proactive interference（前摄干扰）: Circumstances in which past memories make it more difficult to encode and retrieve new information. retroactive interference（倒摄干扰）: Circumstances in which the formation of new memories makes it more difficult to recover older memories. elaborative rehearsal（精细复述）; A technique for improving memory by enriching the encoding of information. mnemonic（记忆术）: Strategy or device that uses familiar information during the encoding of new information to enhance subsequent access to the information in memory. metamemory（元记忆）: Implicit or explicit knowledge about memory abilities and effective memory strategies; cognition about memory. Structures in Long-Term Memory Concepts are the memory building blocks of thinking. The are formed when memory processes gather together classes of objects or ideas with common properties. Concepts are often organized in hierarchies, ranging from general, to basic level, to specific. Schemas are more complex cognitive clusters. All theses memory structures are used to provide expectations and a context for interpreting new information. Remembering is not simply recoding but is a constructive process. People encode flashbulb memories in response to events with great emotional significance, but those memories may not be more accurate than everyday memories. New information can bias recall, making eyewitness memory unreliable when contaminated by post-event input. concepts（概念）: Mental representation of a kind or category of items and ideas. basic level（基础水平）: The level of categorization that can be retrieved from memory most quickly and used most efficiently. schema（图式）: General conceptual framework, or cluster of knowledge, regarding objects, people, and situations; knowledge package that encodes generalizations about the structure of the environment. prototype（原型）: The most representative example of a category. exemplar（范例）: Member of a category that people have encountered. reconstructive memory（重构性记忆）: The process of putting information together based on general types of stored knowledge in the absence of a specific memory representation. flashbulb memory（闪光灯记忆）: People’s vivid and richly detailed memory in response to personal or public events that have great emotional significance. Biological Aspects of Memory Difference brain structures (including the hippocampus, the amygdala, the cerebellum, the striatum, and the cerebral cortex) have been shown to be involved in different types of memories. Experiments with individual with memory disorders have helped investigators understand how different types of memories are acquired and represented in the brain. Brain-imaging techniques have extended knowledge about the brain bases of memory encoding and retrieval. engram（痕迹）: The physical memory trace for information in the brain. amnesia（遗忘症）: A failure of memory caused by physical injury, disease, drug use, or psychological trauma. anterograde amnesia（顺行性遗忘症）: An inability to form explicit memories for events that occur after the time of physical damage to the brain. retrograde amnesia（逆行性遗忘症）: An inability to retrieve memories from the time before physical damage to the brain. Cognitive Processes Studying Cognition Cognitive psychologists study the mental processes and structures that enable you to perceive, use language, reason, solve problems, and make judgments and decisions. Researchers use reaction time measures to break up complex tasks into underlying mental processes. cognitive process（认知过程）: One of the higher mental processes, such as perception, memory, language, problem solving, and abstract thinking. cognition（认知）: Processes of knowing, including attending, remembering, and reasoning; also the content of the processes, such as concepts and memories. cognitive psychology（认知心理学）: The study of higher mental processes such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, and thinking. cognitive science（认知科学）: The interdisciplinary field of study of systems and processes that manipulate information. serial processes（系列过程）: Two or more mental processes that are carried out in order, one after the other. parallel processes（平行过程）: Two or more mental processes that are carried out simultaneously. controlled process（控制过程）: Process that requires attention; it is often difficult to carry out more than one controlled process at a time. automatic process（自动过程）: Process that does not require attention; it can often be performed along with other tasks without interference. Language Use Language users both produce and understand language. Speakers design their utterances to suit particular audiences. Speech errors reveal many of the processes that go into speech planning. Language understanding often requires the use of the context to resolve ambiguities. Memory representations of meaning begin with propositions supplemented with inferences. Studies of language evolution have focused on grammatical structure. The language individuals speak may play a role in determining how they think. language production（语言生成）: What people say, sign, and write, as well as the processes they go through to production these messages. audience design（听众设计）: The process of shaping a message depending on the audience for which it is intended. inference（推论）: Missing information filled in on the basis of a sample of evidence or on the basis of prior beliefs and theories. linguistic relativity（语言相对论）: The hypothesis that the structure of the language an individual speaks has an impact on the way in which that individual thinks about the world. Visual Cognition Visual representations can be used to supplement propositional representations. Visual representations allow you to think about visual aspects of your environment. People form visual representations that combine verbal and visual information. Problem Solving and Reasoning Problem solvers must define initial state, goal state, and the operations that get them from the initial to the goal state. Creativity is often assessed using tests of divergent and convergent thinking. Deductive reasoning involves drawing conclusions from premises based on rules of logic. Inductive reasoning involves inferring a conclusion from evidence based on its likelihood or probability. problem solving（问题解决）: Thinking that is directed toward solving specific problems and that moves from an initial state to a goal state by means of a set of mental operations. reasoning（推理）: The process of thinking in which conclusions are drawn from a set of facts; thinking directed toward a given goal or objective. problem space（问题空间）: The elements that make up a problem: the initial state, the incomplete information or unsatisfactory conditions the person starts with; the goal state, the set of information or state the person wishes to achieve; and the set of operations, the steps the person takes to move from the initial state to the goal state. algorithm（算法）: A step-by-step procedure that always provides the right answer for a particular type of problem. heuristic（启发式）: Cognitive strategies, or ‘’rules of thumb,’’ often used as shortcuts in solving a complex inferential task. think-aloud protocol（出声思维法）: Report made by an experimental participant of the mental process and strategies he or she uses while working on a task. functional fixedness（功能固着）: An inability to perceive a new use for an object previously associated with some other purpose; adversely affects problem solving and creativity. creativity: The ability to generate ideas or products that are both novel and appropriate to the circumstances. divergent thinking: An aspect of creativity characterized by an ability to produce unusual but appropriate responses to problems. convergent thinking: An aspect of creativity characterized by the ability to gather together different sources of information to solve a problem. insight: Circumstances of problem solving in which solutions suddenly come to mind. deductive reasoning（演绎推理）: A form of thinking in which one draws a conclusion that is intended to follow logically from two or more statements or premises. belief-bias effect（信念偏见效应）: A situation that occurs when a person’s prior knowledge, attitudes, or values distort the reasoning process by influencing the person to accept invalid arguments. inductive reasoning（归纳推理）: A form of reasoning in which a conclusion is made about the probability of some state of affairs, based on the available evidence and past experience. Judgement and Decision Making Much of judgment and decision making is guided by heuristics—mental shortcuts that can help individuals reach solutions quickly Availability, representativeness, and anchoring all allow for efficient judgments under uncertainty. Decision making is affected by the way in which different options are framed. The possibility of regret makes some decision hard, particularly for individuals who are maximizers rather than satisficers. mental set: The tendency to respond to a new problem in the manner used to respond to a previous problem. judgement（判断）: The process by which people form options, reach conclusions, and make critical evaluations of events and people based on available material; also, the product of the mental activity. decision making（决策）: The process of choosing between alternatives; selecting or rejecting available options. availability heuristic（可得性启发式）: A judgment based on the information readily available in memory. representativeness heuristic（代表性启发式）: A cognitive strategy that assigns an object to a category on the basis of a few characteristics regarded as representative of that category. anchoring heuristic（锚定启发式）: An insufficient adjustment up or down from an original starting value when judging the probable value of some event or outcome. frame（框架）: A particular description of a choice; the perspective from which a choice is described or framed affects how a decision is made and which option is ultimately exercised. Intelligence and Intelligence Assessment What is Assessment Psychological assessment has a long history, beginning in ancient China. Many important contributions were made by Sir Francis Galton. A useful assessment tool must be reliable, valid, and standardized. A reliable measure gives consistent results. A valid measure assesses the attributes for which the test was designed. Three important types of validity are content validity, criterion-related validity, and construct validity. A standardized test is always administered and scored in the same way; norms allow a person’s score to be compared with the averages of others of the same age, sex, and culture. psychological assessment（心理测量）: The use of specified procedure to evaluate the abilities, behaviors, and personal qualities of people. formal assessment（正式测量）: The systematic procedures and measurement instruments used by trained professionals to assess an individual’s functioning, aptitudes, abilities, or mental states. test-retest reliability（重测信度）: A measure of the correlation between the scores of the same people on the same test given on two different occasions. internal consistency（内部一致性）: A measure of reliability; the degree to which a test yields similar scores across its different parts, such as odd versus even items. content validity（内容效度）: The extent to which a test adequately measures the full range of the domain of interest. criterion-related validity（效标效度）: The degree to which test scores indicate a result on a specific measure that is consistent with some other criterion of the characteristic being assessed. construct validity（结构效度）: The degree to which a test adequately measures an underlying construct. norm（常模）: Standard based on measurement of a large group of people; used for comparing the scores of an individual with those of others within a well-defined group standardization（标准化）: A set of uniform procedures for treating each participant in a test, interview, or experiment, or for encoding data. Intelligence Assessment Binet began the tradition of objective intelligence testing in France in the early 1900s. Scores were given in terms of mental ages and were meant to represent children’s current level of functioning. In the United States, Terman created the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and popularized the concept of IQ. Wechsler designed intelligence tests for adults, children, and preschoolers. The definitions of both intellectual disability and giftedness focus both on IQ scores and day-to-day performance. intelligence（智力）: The global capacity to profit from experience and to go beyond given information about the environment. mental age（心理年龄）: In Binet’s measure of intelligence, the age at which a child is performing intellectually, expressed in terms of the average age at which normal children achieve a particular score. chronological age（生理年龄）: The number of months or years since an individual’s birth. intelligence quotient(IQ, 智商）: An index derived from standardized tests of intelligence; originally obtained by dividing an individual’s mental age by chronological age and then multiplying by 100; now directly computed as an IQ test score. intelligence disability（智力缺陷）: Condition in which individuals have IQ scores of 70-75 or below and also demonstrate limitations in the ability to bring adaptive skills to bear on life tasks. learning disorder（学习障碍）: A disorder defined by a large discrepancy between individuals’ measured IQ and their actual performance. Theories of Intelligence Psychometric analyses of IQ suggest that several basic abilities, such as fluid and crystallized aspects of intelligence, contribute to IQ scores. Contemporary theories conceive of and measure intelligence very broadly by considering the skills and insights people use to solve the types of problems they encounter. Sternberg differentiates analytical, creative, and practical aspects of intelligence. Gardner identifies eight types of intelligence that both include and go beyond the types of intelligence assessed by standard IQ measures. Recent research has focused on emotional intelligence. psychometrics（心理测量学）: The field of psychology that specializes in mental testing. g(g 因素）: According to Spearman, the factor of general intelligence underlying all intelligent performance. crystallized intelligence（晶体智力）: The facet of intelligence involving the knowledge a person has already acquired and the ability to access that knowledge; measures by vocabulary, arithmetic, and general information tests. fluid intelligence（液体智力）: The aspect of intelligence that involves the ability to see complex relationships and solve problems. emotional intelligence: Type of intelligence defined as the abilities to perceive, appraise, and express emotions accurately and appropriately, to use emotions to facilitate thinking, to understand and analyze emotions, to use emotional knowledge effectively, and to regulate one’s emotions to promote both emotional and intellectual growth. The politics if Intelligence Almost from the outset, intelligence tests have been used to make negative claims about ethnic and racial groups. Because of the reasonably high heritability of IQ, some researchers have attributed the lower scores of some racial and cultural groups to innate inferiority. Environmental disadvantages and stereotype threat appear to explain the lower scores of certain groups. Research shows the group differences can be affected through environmental interventions. heritability estimate（遗传力估计）: A statistical estimate of the degree of inheritance of a given trait or behavior, assessed by the degree of similarity between individuals who vary in their extent of genetic similarity. stereotype threat（刻板印象威胁）: The threat associated with being at risk for confirming a negative stereotype of one’s group. Assessment and society Though often useful for prediction and as an indication of current performance, test results should not be used to limit an individual’s opportunities for development and change. When the result of an assessment will affect an individual’s life, the techniques used must be reliable and valid for that individual and for the purpose in question. Human Development Across the Life Span Studying Development Researchers collect normative, longitudinal, and cross-sectional data to document change. development psychology（发展心理学）: The branch of psychology concerned with interaction between physical and psychological processes and with stages of growth from conception throughout the entire life span. normative investigation（常模研究）: Research effort designed to describe what is characteristic of a specific age or developmental stage. developmental age（发展年龄）: The chronological age at which most children show a particular level of physical or mental development. longitudinal design（纵向设计）: A research design in which the same participants are observed repeatedly, sometimes over many years. cross-sectional design（横断设计）: A research method in which groups of participants of different chronological ages are observed and compared at a given time. Physical Development Across the Life Span Environmental factors can affect physical development while a child is still in the womb Newborns and infants possess a remarkable range of capabilities: The are prewired for survival Through puberty, adolescents achieve sexual maturity. Some physical changes in late adulthood are consequences of disuse, not inevitable deterioration. physical development（生理发展）:The bodily changes, maturation, and growth that occur in an organism starting with conception and continuing across the life span. zygote（受精卵）: The single cell that results when a sperm fertilizes an egg. germinal stage（胚种期）: The first two weeks of prenatal development following conception. embryonic stage（胚胎期）: The second stage of prenatal development, lasting from the third through eighth weeks after conception. fetal stage（胎儿期）: The third stage of prenatal development, lasting from the ninth week through birth of the child. teratogen（致畸物）: Environmental factors such as diseases and drugs that cause structural abnormalities in a developing fetus. maturation（成熟）: The continuing influence of heredity throughout development, the age-related physical and behavioral changes characteristic of a species. puberty（青春期）: The process through which sexual maturity is attained. menarche（月经初潮）: Then onset of menstruation. Cognitive Development Across the Life Span Piaget’s key ideas about cognitive development include development of schemes, assimilation, accommodation, and the four-stage theory of discontinuous development. The four stages are sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Many of Piaget’s theories are now being altered by ingenious research paradigms that reveal infants and young children to be more competent than Piaget had thought. Children develop a theory of mind, which is the ability to explain and predict other people’s behavior based on an understanding of their mental states. Cross-cultural research has questioned the universality of cognitive developmental theories. Age-related declines in cognitive functioning are typically evident in only some abilities. cognitive development（认知发展）: The development of processes of knowing, including imagining, perceiving, reasoning, and problem solving. scheme（图式）: Piaget’s term for a cognitive structure that develops as infants and young children learn to interpret the world and adapt to their environment. assimilation（同化）: According to Piaget, the process whereby new cognitive elements are fitted in with old elements or modified to fit more easily; this process works in tandem with accommodation. accommodation（顺应）: According to Piaget, the process of restructuring or modifying cognitive structures so that new information can fit into them more easily; this process works in tandem with assimilation. object permanence（客体恒常性）: The recognition that objects exist independently of an individual’s action or awareness; an import cognitive acquisition of infancy. egocentrism（自我中心）: In cognitive development, the inability of a young child at the preoperational stage to take the perspective of another people. centration（中心化）: Preoperational children’s tendency to focus their attention on only one aspect of a situation and disregard other relevant aspects. conservation（守恒）: According to Piaget, the understanding that physical properties do not change when nothing is added or taken away, even though appearances may change. theory of mind: The ability to explain and predict other people’s behavior based on an understanding of their mental states. internalization（内化）: According to Vygotsky, the process through which children absorb knowledge from the social context. wisdom（智慧）: Expertise in the fundamental pragmatics of life. Acquiring Language Many researchers believe that humans have an inborn language-making capacity. Even so, interactions with adult speakers is an essential part of the language acquisition process. Like scientists, children develop hypotheses about the meanings and grammar of their language. These hypotheses are often constrained by innate principles. phoneme（音素）: Minimal unit of speech in any given language that makes a meaningful difference in speech and production and reception; r and l are two distinct phonemes in English but variations of one in Japanese. infant-directed speech（婴儿指向型言语）: A form of speech addressed to infants that include slower speed, distinctive intonation, and structural simplifications. child-directed speech（儿童指向型言语）: A form of speech addressed to children that includes slower speed, distinctive intonation, and structural simplifications. language-making capacity（语言运用能力）: The innate guidelines or operating principles that children bring to the task of learning a language. over-regularization（过度规则化）: A grammatical error, usually appearing during early language development, in which rules of the language are applied too widely, resulting in incorrect linguistic forms. Social Development Across the Life Span Social development takes place in a particular context. Erik Erikson conceptualized the life span as a series of crises with which individuals must cope. Children begin the process of social development with different temperaments. Socialization begins with an infant’s attachment to a caregiver. Failure to make this attachment leads to numerous physical and psychological problems. Adolescents must develop a personal identity by forming comfortable social relationships with parents and peers. The central concerns of adulthood are organized around the needs of intimacy and generativity. People become less socially active as they grow older because they selectively maintain only those relationships that matter most to them emotionally. People assess their lives, in part, by their ability to contribute positively to the lives of others. social development（社会性发展）: The ways in which individuals’ social interactions and expectations change across the life span. psychosocial stages（心理社会发展阶段）: Proposed by Erik Erikson, one of the successive developmental stages that focus on an individual’s orientation toward the self and others; these stages incorporate both the sexual and social aspects of a person’s development and the social conflicts that arise from the interaction between the individual and the social environment. socialization（社会化）: The lifelong process whereby an individual’s behavioral patterns, values, standards, skills, attitudes, and motives are shaped to conform to those regarded as desirable in a particular society. temperament: A child’s biologically based level of emotional and behavioral response to environmental events. attachment（依恋）: Emotional relationship between a child and the regular caregiver. imprinting（印刻）: A primitive form of learning in which some infant animals physically follow and form an attachment to the first moving object they see and/or hear. parenting style（教养方式）: The manner in which parents rear their children; an authoritative parenting style, which balances demandingness and responsiveness, is seen as the most effective. contact comfort（接触性安慰）: Comfort derived from an infant’s physical contact with the mother or caregiver. intimacy（亲密感）: The capacity to make a full commitment—sexual, emotional, and moral—to another person. generativity（繁殖）: A commitment beyond one’s self and one’s partner to family, work, society, and future generations; typically, a crucial state in development in one’s 30s and 40s. Sex and Gender Differences Research has revealed biologically based sex differences between the brains of men and women. Children’s gender stereotypes are most rigid between ages 5 and 7. Beginning at birth, parents and peers help bring about the socialization of gender roles. sex difference（性差异）: One of the biologically based characteristics that distinguish males from females. gender: A psychological phenomenon that refer to learned sex-related behaviors and attitudes of males and females. gender identity（性别认同）: One’s sense of maleness or famaleness; usually includes awareness and acceptance of one’s biological sex. gender stereotype（性别刻板印象）: Belief about attributes and behaviors regarded as appropriate for males and females in a particular culture. Moral Development Kohlberg defined stages of moral development. Subsequent research has evaluated gender and cultural differences in moral reasoning. morality（道德）: A system of beliefs and values that ensures that individuals will keep their obligations to others in society and will behave in ways that do not interfere with the rights and interest of others. Learning to Age Successfully Successful cognitive aging can be defined as people optimizing their functioning in select domains that are of highest priority to them and compensating for losses by using substitute behavior. selective optimization with compensation（补偿的选择性优化）: A strategy for successful aging in which one makes the most gains while minimizing the impact of losses that accompany normal aging. Motivation Understanding Motivation Motivation is a dynamic concept used to describe the processes directing behavior. Motivational analysis help explain how biological and behavioral processes are related and why people pursue goals despite obstacles and adversity. Drive theory conceptualizes motivation as tension reduction. People are also motivated by incentives, external stimuli that are not related to physiological needs. Instinct theory suggests that motivation often relies on innate stereotypical responses. Social and cognitive psychologists emphasize the individual’s perception of, interpretation of, and reaction to a situation. Abraham Maslow suggested that human needs can be organized hierarchically. Although real human motivation is more complex, Maslow’s theory provides a useful framework for summarizing motivational forces. motivation（动机）: The process of starting, directing, and maintaining physical and psychological activities; includes mechanisms involved in preferences for one activity over another and the vigor and persistence of responses. drive（驱力）: Internal state that arise in response to a disequilibrium in an animal’s physiological needs. homeostasis（动态平衡）: Constancy or equilibrium of the internal conditions of the body. incentive（诱因）: External stimulus or reward that motivates behavior although it does not relate directly to biological needs. instinct（本能）: Preprogrammed tendency that is essential to a species’ survival. social learning theory（社会学习理论）: The learning theory that stresses the role of observation and the imitation of behaviors observed in others. hierarchy of needs（需要层次）: Maslow’s view that basic human motives form a hierarchy and that the needs at each level of the hierarchy must be satisfied before the next level can be achieved; these needs progress from basic biological needs to the need for self-actualization. Eating The body has a number of mechanisms to regulate the initiation and cessation of eating. Cultural norms have an impact on what and how much people eat Genes play an important role in obesity but the impact of genes is affected by environmental factors. If individuals become restrained eaters, their diets may result in weight gain rather than weight loss. Eating disorders are life-threatening illnesses that may arise from genetic factors, misperceptions of body image, and cultural pressures. anorexia nervosa（神经性厌食症）: An eating disorder in which an individual weighs less than 85 percent of her or his expected weight but still expresses intense fear of becoming fat. bulimia nervosa（神经性贪食症）: An eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by measures to purge the body of excess calories. binge eating disorder（暴食症）: An eating disorder characterized by out-of-control binge eating without subsequent purges. Sexual Behaviors From an evolutionary perspective, sex is the mechanism for producing offspring. In animals, the sex drive is largely controlled by hormones. The work of Masters and Johnson provided the first hard data on the sexual response cycles of men and women. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that much of human sexual behavior reflects different mating strategies for men and women. Sexual scripts define culturally appropriate forms of sexual behavior. Homosexuality and heterosexuality are determined both by genetics and personal and social environments. sexual arousal（性唤起）: The motivational state of excitement and tension brought about by physiological and cognitive reactions to erotic stimuli. parental investment（亲本投资）: The time and energy parents must spend raising their offspring. sexual script（性脚本）: Socially learned program of sexual responsiveness. date rape（约会强暴）: Unwanted sexual violation by social acquaintance in the context of a consensual dating situation. Motivation for Personal Achievement People have varying needs for achievement. Motivation for achievement is influenced by how people interpret success and failure. Two attributional style, optimism and pessimism, lead to different attitudes toward achievement and influence motivation. Organizational psychologists study human motivation in work settings. need for achievement(n Ach, 成就需要）: An assumed basic human need to strive for achievement of goals that motivates a wide range of behavior and thinking. It reflects individual differences in the value people place on planning and working toward goals. attribution（归因）:Judgment about the causes of outcomes. People make attribution along the dimensions of internal versus external, global versus specific, and stable versus unstable. organizational psychologist（组织心理学家）: Psychologist who studies various aspects of the human work environment, such as communication among employees, socialization or enculturation of workers, leadership, job satisfaction, stress and burnout, and overall quality of life. equity theory（公平理论）: A cognitive theory of work motivation that proposes that workers are motivated to maintain fair and equitable relationships with other relevant persons; also, a model that postulates that equitable relationships are those in which the participants’ outcomes are proportional to their inputs. expectancy theory（期望理论）: A cognitive theory of work motivation that proposes that workers are motivated when they expect their efforts and job performance to result in desired outcomes. Emotion, Stress, and Health Emotions Emotion are complex patterns of changes made up of physiological arousal, cognitive appraisal, and behavioral and expressive reactions. As a product of evolution, all humans may share a basic set of emotional responses. Cultures, however, vary in their rules of appropriateness for displaying emotions. Classical theories emphasize different parts of emotional response, such as peripheral bodily reactions or central neural processes. More contemporary theories emphasize the appraisal of arousal. Subjective well-being is influenced by both genetics and life experiences. emotion（情绪）: A complex pattern of changes, including physiological arousal, feelings, cognitive processes, and behavioral reactions, made in response to a situation perceived to be personally significant. James-Lange theory of emotion（詹姆斯—兰格情绪理论）: A peripheral-feedback theory of emotion stating that an eliciting stimulus triggers a behavioral response that sends different sensory and motor feedback to the brain and creates the feeling of a specific emotion. Cannon—Bard theory of emotion（坎农—巴德情绪理论）: A theory stating that an emotional stimulus produces two co-occurring reactions—arousal and experience of emotion—that do not cause each other. two-factor theory of emotion（情绪的双因素理论）: The theory that emotional experiences arise from autonomic arousal and cognitive appraisal. cognitive appraisal theory of emotion（情绪的认知评价理论）: A theory stating that the experience of emotion is the joint effect of physiological arousal and cognitive appraisal, which serves to determine how an ambiguous inner state of arousal will be labeled. emotion regulation: The process through which people change the intensity and duration of the emotions they experience. subjective well-being（主观幸福感）: Individuals’ overall evaluation of life satisfaction and happiness. positive psychology（积极心理学）: A movement within psychology that applies research to provide people with the knowledge and skills that allow them to experience fulfilling lives. Stress of Living Stress can arise from negative or positive events. At the root of most stress are change and the need to adapt to environmental, biological, physical, and social demands. Physiological stress reactions are regulated by the hypothalamus and a complex interaction of the hormonal and nervous systems. Depending on the type of stressor and its effect over time, stress can be a mild disruption or lead to health-threatening reactions. Cognitive appraisal is a primary moderator variable of stress. Coping strategies either focus on problems (taking direct actions) or attempt to regulate emotions Cognitive reappraisal and restructuring can be used to cope with stress. Social support is also a significant stress moderator, as long as it is appropriate to the circumstances. Stress can lead to positive changes such as post-traumatic growth. stress（应激）: The pattern of specific and nonspecific responses an organism makes to stimulus events that disturb its equilibrium and tax or exceed its ability to cope. stressor（应激源）: An internal or external event or stimulus that induces stress. acute stress（急性应激）: A transient state of arousal with typically clear onset and offset patterns. chronic stress（慢性应激）: A continuous state of arousal in which an individual perceives demands as greater than the inner and outer resources available for dealing with them. fight-or flight response（战斗或逃跑反应）: A sequence of internal activities triggered when an organism is faced with a threat; prepares the body for combat and struggle or for running away to safety; recent evidence suggests that the response is characteristic only of males. tend-and-befriend response（照料和结盟反应）: A response to stressor that is hypothesized to be typical for females; stressors prompt females to protect their offspring and join social groups to reduce vulnerability of their offspring. general adaptation syndrome(GAS, 一般适应症候群）: The pattern of nonspecific adaptational physiological mechanisms that occurs in response to continuing threat by almost any serious stressor. psychosomatic disorder.（心身失调）: Physical disorder aggravated by or primarily attributable to prolonged emotional stress or other psychological causes. life-change unit（生活变化单位）: In stress research, the measure of the stress levels of different types of changes experienced during a given period. post-traumatic stress disorder（创伤后应激障碍）: An anxiety disorder characterized by the persistent re-experience of traumatic events through distressing recollections, dreams, hallucinations, or dissociative flashbacks; develops in response to rapes, life-threatening events, severe injury, and natural disasters. coping（应对）: The process of dealing with internal or external demands that are perceived to be threatening or overwhelming. stress moderator variable（压力调节变量）: Variable that changes the impact of a stressor on a given type of stress reaction. anticipatory coping（预先应对）: Efforts made in advance of a potentially stressful event to overcome, reduce, or tolerate the imbalance between perceived demands and available resources. perceived control（知觉控制）: The belief that one has the ability to make a difference in the course of the consequences of some event or experience; often helpful in dealing with stressors. social support（社会支持）: Resources, including material aid, socio-emotional support, and informational aid, provided by others to help a person cope with stress. Health Psychology Health psychology is devoted to treatment and prevention of illness. The biopsychosocial model of health and illness looks at the connections among physical, emotional, and environmental factors in illness. Illness prevention focuses on lifestyle factors such as smoking and AIDS-risk behaviors. Psychological factors influence immune function. Psychosocial treatment of illness adds another dimension to patient treatment. Health-care providers are at risk for burnout, which can be minimized by appropriate situational changes in their helping environment. health psychology（健康心理学）: The field of psychology devoted to understanding the ways people stay healthy, the reasons they become ill, and the ways they respond when they become ill. health（健康）: A general condition of soundness and vigor of body and mind; not simply the absence of illness or injury. biopsychosocial model（生物心理社会模型）: A model of health and illness that suggest links among the nervous system, the immune system, behavioral styles, cognitive processing, and environmental domains of health. wellness（最佳健康）: Optimal health, incorporating the ability to function fully and actively over the physical, intellectual, emotional, spiritual, social, and environmental domains of health. health promotion（健康促进）: The development and implementation of general strategies and specific tactics to eliminate or reduce the risk that people will become ill. relaxation response（放松反应）: A condition in which muscle tension, cortical activity, heart rate, and blood pressure decrease and breathing slows. biofeedback（生物反馈）: A self-regulatory technique by which an individual acquires voluntary control over nonconscious biological processes. psychoneuroimmunology（心理神经免疫学）: The research area that investigates interactions between psychological processes, such as responses to stress, and the function of the immune system. job burnout（职业倦怠）: The syndrome of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, often experienced by workers in high-stress jobs. Understanding Human Personality Trait Personality Theories Some theorists view traits—attributes along continuous dimensions—as the building blocks of personality. The five-factor model is a personality system that maps out the relationships among common trait words, theoretical concepts, and personality scales. Twin and adoption studies reveal that personality traits are partially inherited. People display behavioral consistency when situations are defined with respect to relevant psychological features. personality（人格）: The psychological qualities of an individual that influence a variety of characteristic behavior patterns across different situations. trait（特质）: Enduring personal quality or attribute that influence behavior across situations. five-factor model（五因素模型）: A comprehensive descriptive personality system that maps out the relationships among common traits, theoretical concepts, and personality scales; informally called the Big Five. consistency paradox（一致性矛盾）: The observation that personality ratings across time and among different observers are consistent while behavior ratings across situations are not consistent. Psychodynamic Theories Freud’s psychodynamic theory emphasizes instinctive biological energies as sources of human motivation. Basic concepts of Freudian theory include psychic energy as powering and directing behavior, early experiences as key determinants of lifelong personality, psychic determinism, and powerful unconscious processes. Personality structure consists of the id, the superego, and the reconciling ego. Unacceptable impulses are repressed and ego defense mechanisms are developed to lessen anxiety and bolster self-esteem. Post-Freudians like Adler, Horney, and Jung put greater emphasis on ego functioning and social variables and less on sexual urges. They saw personality development as a lifelong process. psychodynamic personality theory（心理动力学的人格理论）: Theory of personality that shares the assumption that personality is shaped by and behavior is motivated by inner forces. libido（力比多）: The psychic energy that drives individuals toward sensual pleasures of all types, especially sexual ones. fixation（固着）: A state in which a person remains attached to objects or activities more appropriate for an earlier stage of psychosexual development. psychic determinism（精神决定论）: The assumption that mental and behavioral reactions are determined by previous experiences. unconscious（无意识）: The domain of the psyche that stores repressed urges and primitive impulses. id（本我）: The primitive, unconscious part of the personality that represents the internalization of society’s values, standards, and morals. superego（超我）: The aspect of personality that represents the internalization of society’s values, standards, and morals. ego（自我）: The aspect of personality involved in self-preservation activities and in directing instinctual drives and urges into appropriate channels. repression（压抑）: The basic defense mechanism by which painful or guilt-producing thoughts, feelings, or memories are excluded from conscious awareness. ego defense mechanism（自我防御机制）: Mental strategy(conscious or unconscious) used by the ego to defend itself against conflicts experienced in the normal course of life. anxiety（焦虑）: An intense emotional response caused by the preconscious recognition that a repressed conflict is about to emerge into consciousness. collective unconscious（集体无意识）: The part of an individual’s unconscious that is inherited, evolutionarily developed, and common to all members of the species. archetype（原型）: A universal, inherited, primitive, and symbolic representation of a particular experience or object. analytic psychology（分析心理学）: A branch of psychology that views the person as a constellation of compensatory internal forces in a dynamic balance. Humanistic Theories Humanistic theories focus on self-actualization—the growth potential of the individual. These theories are holistic, dispositional, and phenomenological. Contemporary theories in the humanist tradition focus on individuals’ life stories. self-concept（自我概念）: A person’s mental model of his or her typical behaviors and unique qualities. self-actualization（自我实现）: A concept in personality psychology referring to a person’s constant striving to realize his or her potential and to develop inherent talents and capabilities. unconditional positive regard（无条件积极关注）: Complete love and acceptance of an individual by other person, such as a parent for a child, with no conditions attached. psychobiography（心理传记）: The use of psychological (especially personality) theory to describe and explain an individual’s course through life. Social-Learning and Cognitive Theories Social-learning theorists focus on understanding individual differences in behavior and personality as a consequence of different histories of reinforcement. Cognitive theorists emphasize individual differences in perception and subjective interpretation of the environment. Julian Rotter emphasized people’s expectancies about rewards, including general internal or external locus of control orientations. People who have an external locus of control orientation believe that rewards are largely contingent on environmental factors. Walter Mischel explored the origins of behaviors as interactions of persons and situations. Mischel’s theory focuses on encodings, expectancies and beliefs, affects, goals and values, and competencies and self regulatory plans. Albert Bandura described the reciprocal determinism among people, environments, and behaviors. expectancy（期望）: The extent to which people believe that their behaviors in particular situations will bring about rewards. locus of control（控制点）: People’s general expectancy about the extent to which the rewards they obtain are contingent on their own actions or on environmental factors. reciprocal determinism（交互决定）: A concept of Albert Bandura’s social-learning theory that refers to the notion that a complex reciprocal interaction exists among the individual, his or her behavior, and environmental stimuli and that each of these components affects the others. self-efficacy（自我效能）: A belief that one can perform adequately in a particular situation. Self Theories Self theories focus on the importance of the self-concept for a full understanding of human personality. People engage in behaviors such as self-handicapping to maintain self-esteem. Terror management theory suggests that self-esteem helps people cope with thoughts about death. Cross-cultural research suggests that individualistic cultures give rise to independent construals of self, whereas collectivist cultures give rise to interdependent construals of self. self-esteem（自尊）: A generalized evaluative attitude toward the self that influences both moods and behavior and that exerts a powerful effect on a range of personal and social behaviors. self-handicapping（自我妨碍）: The process of developing, in anticipation of failure, behavioral reactions and explanations that minimize ability deficits as possible attributions for the failure. terror management theory: A theory proposing that self-esteem helps people cope with the inevitability of death. independent construal of self（独立的自我构建）: Conceptualization of the self as an individual whose behavior is organized primarily by reference to one’s own thoughts, feelings, and actions, rather than by reference to the thoughts, feelings, and the actions of others. interdependent construal of self（互依的自我构建）: Conceptualization of the self as...? Comparing Personality Theories Personality theories can be contrasted with respect to the emphasis they put on heredity versus environment; learning processes versus innate laws of behavior; the past, present, or future; consciousness versus unconsciousness; and inner dispositions versus outer situations. Each theory makes different contributions to the understanding of human personality. Assessing Personality personality inventory（人格量表）: A self-report questionnaire used for personality assessment that includes a series of items about personal thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. projective test（投射测验）: A method of personality assessment in which an individual is presented with a standardized set of ambiguous, abstract stimuli and asked to interpret their meanings; the individual’s responses are assumed to reveal inner feelings, motives, and conflicts. Personality characteristics are assessed by both objective and projective tests. The most common objective test, the MMPI-2, is used to diagnose clinical problems. The NEO-PI is an objective test that measures five major dimensions of personality. Projective tests of personality ask people to respond to ambiguous stimuli. Two important projective tests are the Rorschach test and the TAT. Psychological Disorders The Nature of Psychological Disorders Abnormality is judged by the degree to which a person’s actions resemble a set of indictors that include distress, maladaptiveness, irrationality, unpredictability, unconventionality, observer discomfort, and violation of standards or societal norms. Objectivity is an important problem for discussions of mental illness. Classification systems for psychological disorders should provide a common shorthand for communicating about general types of a psychopathologies and specific cases. The most widely accepted diagnostic and classification system is DSM-IV-TR The biological approach to the etiology of mental illness concentrates on abnormalities in the brain, biochemical processes, and genetic influences. Psychological approaches include psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, and sociocultural models. psychopathological functioning（心理病理功能） : Disruptions in emotional. behavioral, or thought processes that lead to personal distress or block one’s ability to achieve important goals. abnormal psychology（变态心理学）: The area of psychological investigation concerned with understanding the nature of individual pathologies of mind, mood, and behavior. psychological diagnosis（心理诊断）: The label given to psychological abnormality by classifying and categorizing the observed behavior pattern into an approved diagnostic system. DSM-IV-TR: The current diagnostic and statistical manual of the American Psychological Association that classifies, defines, and describes mental disorders. comorbidity（共病）: The experience of more than one disorder at the same time. neurotic disorder（神经症性障碍）: Mental disorder in which a person does not have signs of brain abnormalities and does not display grossly irrational thinking or violate basic norms but does experience subjective distress; a category dropped from DSM-III psychotic disorder（精神症性障碍）: Severe mental disorder in which a person experiences impairments in reality testing manifested through thought, emotional, or perceptual difficulties; no longer used as diagnostic category after DSM-III insanity（精神病）: The legal (not clinical) designation for the state of an individual judged to be legally irresponsible or incompetent. etiology（病理学）: The causes of, or factors related to, the development of a disorder. Anxiety Disorders The five major type of anxiety disorder are generalized, panic, phobic, obsessive-compulsive, and post-traumatic stress. Research has confirmed genetic and brain bases for anxiety disorders as well as behavioral and cognitive components of causality. anxiety disorder（焦虑障碍） generalized anxiety disorder（广泛性焦虑障碍） panic disorder（惊恐障碍） agoraphobia（广场恐惧症） fear（恐惧） phobia（恐惧症） social phobia（社交恐惧症） specific phobia（特殊恐惧症） obsessive-compulsive disorder （强迫症，OCD) Mood Disorders Major depressive disorder is the most common mood disorder; bipolar disorder is much rarer. People have genetic predispositions toward mood disorders. Mood disorders change the way people respond to life experiences. Women’s higher level of major depressive disorder may reflect differences in negative life experiences as well as cognitive responses to those experiences. Suicides are most frequent among people suffering from depression. mood disorder（心境障碍） major depressive disorder（重度抑郁症） bipolar disorder（双相障碍） manic episode（躁狂阶段） learned helplessness（习得性无助） Somatoform Disorders Somatoform disorder such as hypochondriasis, somatization disorder, and conversion disorder are characterized by circumstances in which physical illnesses or complaints cannot be fully explained by actual medical conditions. Dissociative disorders involve a disruption of the somatoform disorder（躯体形式障碍） hypochondriasis（疑病症） somatization disorder（躯体化障碍） conversion disorder（转换性障碍） dissociative disorder（分离性障碍） dissociative amnesia（分离性失忆） dissociative fugue（分离性神游） dissociative identity disorder （分离性身份识别障碍） Schizophrenic Disorders schizophrenic disorder（精神分裂症） delusion（妄想） Personality Disorders personality disorder（人格障碍） borderline personality disorder（边缘型人格障碍） antisocial personality disorder（反社会型人格障碍） Psychological Disorders of Childhood attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder （注意缺陷多动障碍，ADHD) autistic disorder（孤独症） The Stigma of Mental illness stigma（污名） Therapies for Psychological Disorders Social Psychology Constructing Social Reality Each person constructs his or her own social reality. Social perception is influenced by beliefs and expectations. Attribution theory describes the judgments people make about the causes of behaviors. Several biases, such as the fundamental attribution error, self-serving biases, and self-fulfilling prophecies, can creep into attributions and other judgments and behaviors. social psychology（社会心理学）: The branch of psychology that studies the effect of social variables on individual behavior, attitudes, perceptions, and motives; also studies group and intergroup phenomena. social cognition（社会认知）: The process by which people select, interpret, and remember social information. social perception（社会知觉）: The process by which a person comes to know or perceive the personal attributes. attribution theory（归因理论）: A social-cognitive approach to describing the ways the social perceiver uses information to generate causal explanations. covariation model（协变模型）: A theory that suggests that people attribute a behavior to a causal factor if that factor was present whenever the behavior occurred but was absent whenever it didn’t occur. fundamental attribution error(FAE, 基本归因错误）: The dual tendency of observers to underestimate the impact of situational factors and to overestimate the influence of dispositional factors on a person’s behavior. self-serving bias（自我服务偏差）: An attributional bias in which people tend to take credit for their successes and deny responsibility for their failures. self-fulfilling prophecy（自我实现预言）: A prediction made about some future behavior or event that modifies interactions so as to produce what is expected. The Power of the Situation Being assigned to play a social role, even in artificial settings, can cause individuals to act contrary to their beliefs, values, and dispositions. Social norms shape the attitudes and behaviors of group members. Classic research by Sherif and Asch illustrated the informational and normative forces that lead to conformity. Minority influence may arise as a consequence of informational influence. Milgram’s studies on obedience are a powerful testimony to the influence of the situational factors that can lead ordinary people to sanction and participate in organized aggression. social role（社会角色）: A socially defined pattern of behavior that is expected of a person who is functioning in a given setting or group. rule（规则）: Behavioral guideline for acting in a certain way in a certain situation. social norm（社会规范）: The expectation a group has for its members regarding acceptable and appropriate attitudes and behaviors. conformity（从众）: The tendency of people to adopt the behaviors, attitudes, and values of other members of a reference group. informational influence（信息性影响）: Group effects that arise from individuals’ desire to be correct and right and to understand how best to act in a given situation. normative influence（规范性影响）: Group effects that arise from individuals’ desire to be liked, accepted, and approved of by others. norm crystallization（规范具体化）: The convergency of the expectation of a group of individuals into a common perspective as they talk and carry out activities together. group polarization（群体极化）: The tendency for groups to make decisions that are more extreme than the decisions that would be made by the members acting alone. groupthink（群体思维）: The tendency of a decision-making group to filter out undesirable input so that a consensus may be reached, especially if it is in line with the leader’s viewpoint. Attitudes, Attitude Change, and Action Attitudes are positive or negative evaluations of objects, events, or ideas. Not all attitudes accurately predicts behaviors; they must be highly accessible or highly stable. According to the elaboration likelihood model, the central route to persuasion relies on careful analyses of arguments, whereas the peripheral route relies on superficial features of persuasive situations Dissonance theory and self-perception theory consider attitude formation and change that arise from behavioral acts. To bring about compliance, people can exploit reciprocity, consistency, and commitment. attitude（态度）: The learned, relatively stable tendency to respond to people, concepts, and events in an evaluative way. persuasion（说服）: Deliberate efforts to change attitudes. elaboration likelihood model（精细可能性模型）: A theory of persuasion that defines how likely it is that people will focus their cognitive processes to elaborate upon a message and therefore follow the central and peripheral routes to persuasion. cognitive dissonance（认知失调）: The theory that the tension-producing effects of incongruous cognitions motivate individuals to reduce such tension. self-perception theory（自我知觉理论）: The idea that people observe themselves to figure out the reasons they act as they do; people infer what their internal states are by perceiving how they are acting in a given situation. compliance（顺从）: A change in behavior consistent with a communication source’s direct requests. reciprocity norm（互惠规范）: Expectation that favors will be returned—if someone does something for another person, that person should do something in return. Prejudice Even arbitrary, minimal cues can yield prejudice when they define an in-group and an out-group. Stereotypes affect the way in which people evaluate behaviors and information in the world. Implicit prejudice often has an impact on people’s behavior. Researchers have eliminated some of the effects of prejudice by creating situations in which members of different groups must cooperate to reach shared goals. Cross-cultural studies also suggest that friendship plays an important role in eliminating prejudice. prejudice（偏见）: A learned attitude toward a target object, involving negative affect (dislike or fear), negative beliefs (stereotypes) that justify the attitude, and a behavioral intention to avoid, control, dominate, or eliminate the target object. social categorization: The process by which people organize the social environment by categorizing themselves and others into groups. in-group（内群体）: A group with which people identify as members. out-group（外群体）: A group with which people do not identify. in-group bias（内群体偏见）: People’s tendency to favor members of their own group over members of other groups. racism（种族主义）: Discrimination against people based on their skin color or ethnic heritage. sexism（性别主义）: Discrimination against people because of their sex. stereotype（刻板印象）: Generalization about a group of people in which the same characteristics are assigned to all members of a group. implicit prejudice: Prejudice that exists outside an individual’s conscious awareness. contact hypothesis（接触假设）: The prediction that contact between groups will reduce prejudice only if the contact includes features such as cooperation toward shared goals. Social Relationship Interpersonal attraction is determined in part by proximity, physical attractiveness, similarity, and reciprocity. Loving relationships are defined with respect to passion, intimacy, and commitment. A culture’s attachment style affects the quality of relationships. Aggression, Altruism, and Prosocial Behavior Individual differences in aggressive behavior reflect genetics, brain function, and personality profiles. Frustration and provocation can lead to aggression. Cultures provide different norms for aggressive behavior. Researchers have tried to explain why people engage in prosocial behaviors, particularly altruistic behaviors that do not serve their own interests. Evolutionary explanations focus on kinship and reciprocity. Bystander intervention studies show that situations largely determine who is likely or unlikely to help in emergencies. aggression（攻击）: Behaviors that cause psychological or physical harm to another individual. prosocial behavior（亲社会行为）: Behavior that is carried out with the goal of helping other people. altruism（利他行为）: Prosocial behaviors a person carries out without considering his or her own safety or interest. impulsive aggression（冲动性攻击）: Emotion-driven aggression in reaction to the heat of the moment, instrumental aggression（工具性攻击）: Cognition-based and goal-directed aggression carried out with premeditated thought, to achieve specific aims. frustration-aggression hypothesis（挫折 - 攻击假设）: According to this hypothesis, frustration occurs in situations in which people are prevented or blocked from attaining their goals; a rise in frustration then leads to a great probability of aggression. reciprocal altruism（互惠性利他主义）: The idea that people perform altruistic behaviors because they expect that others will perform altruistic behaviors for them in turn. bystander intervention（旁观者介入）: Willingness to assist a person in need of help. diffusion of responsibility（责任分散）: In emergency situations, the larger the number of bystanders, the less responsibility any one of the bystanders feels to help.
